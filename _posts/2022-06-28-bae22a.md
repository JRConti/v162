abstract: Noisy labels are inevitable yet problematic in machine learning society.
  It ruins the generalization of a classifier by making the classifier over-fitted
  to noisy labels. Existing methods on noisy label have focused on modifying the classifier
  during the training procedure. It has two potential problems. First, these methods
  are not applicable to a pre-trained classifier without further access to training.
  Second, it is not easy to train a classifier and regularize all negative effects
  from noisy labels, simultaneously. We suggest a new branch of method, Noisy Prediction
  Calibration (NPC) in learning with noisy labels. Through the introduction and estimation
  of a new type of transition matrix via generative model, NPC corrects the noisy
  prediction from the pre-trained classifier to the true label as a post-processing
  scheme. We prove that NPC theoretically aligns with the transition matrix based
  methods. Yet, NPC empirically provides more accurate pathway to estimate true label,
  even without involvement in classifier learning. Also, NPC is applicable to any
  classifier trained with noisy label methods, if training instances and its predictions
  are available. Our method, NPC, boosts the classification performances of all baseline
  models on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The implemented code is available
  at https://github.com/BaeHeeSun/NPC.
