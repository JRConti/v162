title: Revisiting Consistency Regularization for Deep Partial Label Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Partial label learning (PLL), which refers to the classification task where
  each training instance is ambiguously annotated with a set of candidate labels,
  has been recently studied in deep learning paradigm. Despite advances in recent
  deep PLL literature, existing methods (e.g., methods based on self-training or contrastive
  learning) are confronted with either ineffectiveness or inefficiency. In this paper,
  we revisit a simple idea namely consistency regularization, which has been shown
  effective in traditional PLL literature, to guide the training of deep models. Towards
  this goal, a new regularized training framework, which performs supervised learning
  on non-candidate labels and employs consistency regularization on candidate labels,
  is proposed for PLL. We instantiate the regularization term by matching the outputs
  of multiple augmentations of an instance to a conformal label distribution, which
  can be adaptively inferred by the closed-form solution. Experiments on benchmark
  datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with other
  state-of-the-art methods.
