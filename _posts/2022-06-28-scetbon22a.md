title: An Asymptotic Test for Conditional Independence using Analytic Kernel Embeddings
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We propose a new conditional dependence measure and a statistical test for
  conditional independence. The measure is based on the difference between analytic
  kernel embeddings of two well-suited distributions evaluated at a finite set of
  locations. We obtain its asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis of conditional
  independence and design a consistent statistical test from it. We conduct a series
  of experiments showing that our new test outperforms state-of-the-art methods both
  in terms of type-I and type-II errors even in the high dimensional setting.
