title: Variational On-the-Fly Personalization
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: With the development of deep learning (DL) technologies, the demand for
  DL-based services on personal devices, such as mobile phones, also increases rapidly.
  In this paper, we propose a novel personalization method, Variational On-the-Fly
  Personalization. Compared to the conventional personalization methods that require
  additional fine-tuning with personal data, the proposed method only requires forwarding
  a handful of personal data on-the-fly. Assuming even a single personal data can
  convey the characteristics of a target person, we develop the variational hyper-personalizer
  to capture the weight distribution of layers that fits the target person. In the
  testing phase, the hyper-personalizer estimates the modelâ€™s weights on-the-fly based
  on personality by forwarding only a small amount of (even a single) personal enrollment
  data. Hence, the proposed method can perform the personalization without any training
  software platform and additional cost in the edge device. In experiments, we show
  our approach can effectively generate reliable personalized models via forwarding
  (not back-propagating) a handful of samples.
