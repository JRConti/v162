title: Robust Policy Learning over Multiple Uncertainty Sets
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Reinforcement learning (RL) agents need to be robust to variations in safety-critical
  environments. While system identification methods provide a way to infer the variation
  from online experience, they can fail in settings where fast identification is not
  possible. Another dominant approach is robust RL which produces a policy that can
  handle worst-case scenarios, but these methods are generally designed to achieve
  robustness to a single uncertainty set that must be specified at train time. Towards
  a more general solution, we formulate the multi-set robustness problem to learn
  a policy robust to different perturbation sets. We then design an algorithm that
  enjoys the benefits of both system identification and robust RL: it reduces uncertainty
  where possible given a few interactions, but can still act robustly with respect
  to the remaining uncertainty. On a diverse set of control tasks, our approach demonstrates
  improved worst-case performance on new environments compared to prior methods based
  on system identification and on robust RL alone.'
