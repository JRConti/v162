title: Path-Gradient Estimators for Continuous Normalizing Flows
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Recent work has established a path-gradient estimator for simple variational
  Gaussian distributions and has argued that the path-gradient is particularly beneficial
  in the regime in which the variational distribution approaches the exact target
  distribution. In many applications, this regime can however not be reached by a
  simple Gaussian variational distribution. In this work, we overcome this crucial
  limitation by proposing a path-gradient estimator for the considerably more expressive
  variational family of continuous normalizing flows. We outline an efficient algorithm
  to calculate this estimator and establish its superior performance empirically.
