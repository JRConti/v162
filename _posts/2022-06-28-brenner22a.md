title: Tractable Dendritic RNNs for Reconstructing Nonlinear Dynamical Systems
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In many scientific disciplines, we are interested in inferring the nonlinear
  dynamical system underlying a set of observed time series, a challenging task in
  the face of chaotic behavior and noise. Previous deep learning approaches toward
  this goal often suffered from a lack of interpretability and tractability. In particular,
  the high-dimensional latent spaces often required for a faithful embedding, even
  when the underlying dynamics lives on a lower-dimensional manifold, can hamper theoretical
  analysis. Motivated by the emerging principles of dendritic computation, we augment
  a dynamically interpretable and mathematically tractable piecewise-linear (PL) recurrent
  neural network (RNN) by a linear spline basis expansion. We show that this approach
  retains all the theoretically appealing properties of the simple PLRNN, yet boosts
  its capacity for approximating arbitrary nonlinear dynamical systems in comparatively
  low dimensions. We employ two frameworks for training the system, one combining
  BPTT with teacher forcing, and another based on fast and scalable variational inference.
  We show that the dendritically expanded PLRNN achieves better reconstructions with
  fewer parameters and dimensions on various dynamical systems benchmarks and compares
  favorably to other methods, while retaining a tractable and interpretable structure.
