title: A Natural Actor-Critic Framework for Zero-Sum Markov Games
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We introduce algorithms based on natural actor-critic and analyze their
  sample complexity for solving two player zero-sum Markov games in the tabular case.
  Our results improve the best-known sample complexities of policy gradient/actor-critic
  methods for convergence to Nash equilibrium in the multi-agent setting. We use the
  error propagation scheme in approximate dynamic programming, recent advances for
  global convergence of policy gradient methods, temporal difference learning, and
  techniques from stochastic primal-dual optimization. Our algorithms feature two
  stages, requiring agents to agree on an etiquette before starting their interactions,
  which is feasible for instance in self-play. However, the agents only access to
  joint reward and joint next state and not to each otherâ€™s actions or policies. Our
  complexity results match the best-known results for global convergence of policy
  gradient algorithms for single agent RL. We provide numerical verification of our
  methods for a two player bandit environment and a two player game, Alesia. We observe
  improved empirical performance as compared to the recently proposed optimistic gradient
  descent-ascent variant for Markov games.
