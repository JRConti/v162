title: 'NP-Match: When Neural Processes meet Semi-Supervised Learning'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has been widely explored in recent years,
  and it is an effective way of leveraging unlabeled data to reduce the reliance on
  labeled data. In this work, we adjust neural processes (NPs) to the semi-supervised
  image classification task, resulting in a new method named NP-Match. NP-Match is
  suited to this task for two reasons. Firstly, NP-Match implicitly compares data
  points when making predictions, and as a result, the prediction of each unlabeled
  data point is affected by the labeled data points that are similar to it, which
  improves the quality of pseudolabels. Secondly, NP-Match is able to estimate uncertainty
  that can be used as a tool for selecting unlabeled samples with reliable pseudo-labels.
  Compared with uncertainty-based SSL methods implemented with Monte Carlo (MC) dropout,
  NP-Match estimates uncertainty with much less computational overhead, which can
  save time at both the training and the testing phases. We conducted extensive experiments
  on four public datasets, and NP-Match outperforms state-of-theart (SOTA) results
  or achieves competitive results on them, which shows the effectiveness of NPMatch
  and its potential for SSL.
