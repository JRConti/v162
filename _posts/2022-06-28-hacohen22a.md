title: 'Active Learning on a Budget: Opposite Strategies Suit High and Low Budgets'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Investigating active learning, we focus on the relation between the number
  of labeled examples (budget size), and suitable querying strategies. Our theoretical
  analysis shows a behavior reminiscent of phase transition: typical examples are
  best queried when the budget is low, while unrepresentative examples are best queried
  when the budget is large. Combined evidence shows that a similar phenomenon occurs
  in common classification models. Accordingly, we propose TypiClust – a deep active
  learning strategy suited for low budgets. In a comparative empirical investigation
  of supervised learning, using a variety of architectures and image datasets, TypiClust
  outperforms all other active learning strategies in the low-budget regime. Using
  TypiClust in the semi-supervised framework, performance gets an even more significant
  boost. In particular, state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods trained on CIFAR-10
  with 10 labeled examples selected by TypiClust, reach 93.2% accuracy – an improvement
  of 39.4% over random selection. Code is available at https://github.com/avihu111/TypiClust.'
