title: Learning Iterative Reasoning through Energy Minimization
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Deep learning has excelled on complex pattern recognition tasks such as
  image classification and object recognition. However, it struggles with tasks requiring
  nontrivial reasoning, such as algorithmic computation. Humans are able to solve
  such tasks through iterative reasoning â€“ spending more time to think about harder
  tasks. Most existing neural networks, however, exhibit a fixed computational budget
  controlled by the neural network architecture, preventing additional computational
  processing on harder tasks. In this work, we present a new framework for iterative
  reasoning with neural networks. We train a neural network to parameterize an energy
  landscape over all outputs, and implement each step of the iterative reasoning as
  an energy minimization step to find a minimal energy solution. By formulating reasoning
  as an energy minimization problem, for harder problems that lead to more complex
  energy landscapes, we may then adjust our underlying computational budget by running
  a more complex optimization procedure. We empirically illustrate that our iterative
  reasoning approach can solve more accurate and generalizable algorithmic reasoning
  tasks in both graph and continuous domains. Finally, we illustrate that our approach
  can recursively solve algorithmic problems requiring nested reasoning.
