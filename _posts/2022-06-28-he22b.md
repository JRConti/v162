title: 'GNNRank: Learning Global Rankings from Pairwise Comparisons via Directed Graph
  Neural Networks'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Recovering global rankings from pairwise comparisons has wide applications
  from time synchronization to sports team ranking. Pairwise comparisons corresponding
  to matches in a competition can be construed as edges in a directed graph (digraph),
  whose nodes represent e.g. competitors with an unknown rank. In this paper, we introduce
  neural networks into the ranking recovery problem by proposing the so-called GNNRank,
  a trainable GNN-based framework with digraph embedding. Moreover, new objectives
  are devised to encode ranking upsets/violations. The framework involves a ranking
  score estimation approach, and adds an inductive bias by unfolding the Fiedler vector
  computation of the graph constructed from a learnable similarity matrix. Experimental
  results on extensive data sets show that our methods attain competitive and often
  superior performance against baselines, as well as showing promising transfer ability.
