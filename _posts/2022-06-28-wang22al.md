  Learning Framework'

abstract: In this work, we pursue a unified paradigm for multimodal pretraining to
  break the shackles of complex task/modality-specific customization. We propose OFA,
  a Task-Agnostic and Modality-Agnostic framework that supports Task Comprehensiveness.
  OFA unifies a diverse set of cross-modal and unimodal tasks, including image generation,
  visual grounding, image captioning, image classification, language modeling, etc.,
  in a simple sequence-to-sequence learning framework. OFA follows the instruction-based
  learning in both pretraining and finetuning stages, requiring no extra task-specific
  layers for downstream tasks. In comparison with the recent state-of-the-art vision
  & language models that rely on extremely large cross-modal datasets, OFA is pretrained
  on only 20M publicly available image-text pairs. Despite its simplicity and relatively
  small-scale training data, OFA achieves new SOTAs in a series of cross-modal tasks
  while attaining highly competitive performances on uni-modal tasks. Our further
  analysis indicates that OFA can also effectively transfer to unseen tasks and unseen
  domains. Our code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/OFA-Sys/OFA.
