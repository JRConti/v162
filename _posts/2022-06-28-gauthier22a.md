title: 'UniRank: Unimodal Bandit Algorithms for Online Ranking'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We tackle, in the multiple-play bandit setting, the online ranking problem
  of assigning L items to K predefined positions on a web page in order to maximize
  the number of user clicks. We propose a generic algorithm, UniRank, that tackles
  state-of-the-art click models. The regret bound of this algorithm is a direct consequence
  of the pseudo-unimodality property of the bandit setting with respect to a graph
  where nodes are ordered sets of indistinguishable items. The main contribution of
  UniRank is its O(L/$\Delta$ logT) regret for T consecutive assignments, where $\Delta$
  relates to the reward-gap between two items. This regret bound is based on the usually
  implicit condition that two items may not have the same attractiveness. Experiments
  against state-of-the-art learning algorithms specialized or not for different click
  models, show that our method has better regret performance than other generic algorithms
  on real life and synthetic datasets.
