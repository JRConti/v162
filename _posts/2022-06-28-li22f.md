title: On the Finite-Time Performance of the Knowledge Gradient Algorithm
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The knowledge gradient (KG) algorithm is a popular and effective algorithm
  for the best arm identification (BAI) problem. Due to the complex calculation of
  KG, theoretical analysis of this algorithm is difficult, and existing results are
  mostly about the asymptotic performance of it, e.g., consistency, asymptotic sample
  allocation, etc. In this research, we present new theoretical results about the
  finite-time performance of the KG algorithm. Under independent and normally distributed
  rewards, we derive lower bounds and upper bounds for the probability of error and
  simple regret of the algorithm. With these bounds, existing asymptotic results become
  simple corollaries. We also show the performance of the algorithm for the multi-armed
  bandit (MAB) problem. These developments not only extend the existing analysis of
  the KG algorithm, but can also be used to analyze other improvement-based algorithms.
  Last, we use numerical experiments to further demonstrate the finite-time behavior
  of the KG algorithm.
