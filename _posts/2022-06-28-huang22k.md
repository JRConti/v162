title: On the Learning of Non-Autoregressive Transformers
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Non-autoregressive Transformer (NAT) is a family of text generation models,
  which aims to reduce the decoding latency by predicting the whole sentences in parallel.
  However, such latency reduction sacrifices the ability to capture left-to-right
  dependencies, thereby making NAT learning very challenging. In this paper, we present
  theoretical and empirical analyses to reveal the challenges of NAT learning and
  propose a unified perspective to understand existing successes. First, we show that
  simply training NAT by maximizing the likelihood can lead to an approximation of
  marginal distributions but drops all dependencies between tokens, where the dropped
  information can be measured by the datasetâ€™s conditional total correlation. Second,
  we formalize many previous objectives in a unified framework and show that their
  success can be concluded as maximizing the likelihood on a proxy distribution, leading
  to a reduced information loss. Empirical studies show that our perspective can explain
  the phenomena in NAT learning and guide the design of new training methods.
