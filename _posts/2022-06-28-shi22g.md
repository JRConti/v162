title: Robust Group Synchronization via Quadratic Programming
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'We propose a novel quadratic programming formulation for estimating the
  corruption levels in group synchronization, and use these estimates to solve this
  problem. Our objective function exploits the cycle consistency of the group and
  we thus refer to our method as detection and estimation of structural consistency
  (DESC). This general framework can be extended to other algebraic and geometric
  structures. Our formulation has the following advantages: it can tolerate corruption
  as high as the information-theoretic bound, it does not require a good initialization
  for the estimates of group elements, it has a simple interpretation, and under some
  mild conditions the global minimum of our objective function exactly recovers the
  corruption levels. We demonstrate the competitive accuracy of our approach on both
  synthetic and real data experiments of rotation averaging.'
