title: Tractable Uncertainty for Structure Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Bayesian structure learning allows one to capture uncertainty over the causal
  directed acyclic graph (DAG) responsible for generating given data. In this work,
  we present Tractable Uncertainty for STructure learning (TRUST), a framework for
  approximate posterior inference that relies on probabilistic circuits as a representation
  of our posterior belief. In contrast to sample-based posterior approximations, our
  representation can capture a much richer space of DAGs, while being able to tractably
  answer a range of useful inference queries. We empirically demonstrate how probabilistic
  circuits can be used to as an augmented representation for structure learning methods,
  leading to improvement in both the quality of inferred structures and posterior
  uncertainty. Experimental results also demonstrate the improved representational
  capacity of TRUST, outperforming competing methods on conditional query answering.
