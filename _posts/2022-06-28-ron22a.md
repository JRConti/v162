title: Dual Decomposition of Convex Optimization Layers for Consistent Attention in
  Medical Images
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: A key concern in integrating machine learning models in medicine is the
  ability to interpret their reasoning. Popular explainability methods have demonstrated
  satisfactory results in natural image recognition, yet in medical image analysis,
  many of these approaches provide partial and noisy explanations. Recently, attention
  mechanisms have shown compelling results both in their predictive performance and
  in their interpretable qualities. A fundamental trait of attention is that it leverages
  salient parts of the input which contribute to the model’s prediction. To this end,
  our work focuses on the explanatory value of attention weight distributions. We
  propose a multi-layer attention mechanism that enforces consistent interpretations
  between attended convolutional layers using convex optimization. We apply duality
  to decompose the consistency constraints between the layers by reparameterizing
  their attention probability distributions. We further suggest learning the dual
  witness by optimizing with respect to our objective; thus, our implementation uses
  standard back-propagation, hence it is highly efficient. While preserving predictive
  performance, our proposed method leverages weakly annotated medical imaging data
  and provides complete and faithful explanations to the model’s prediction.
