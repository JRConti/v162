title: Anytime Information Cascade Popularity Prediction via Self-Exciting Processes
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: One important aspect of understanding behaviors of information cascades
  is to be able to accurately predict their popularity, that is, their message counts
  at any future time. Self-exciting Hawkes processes have been widely adopted for
  such tasks due to their success in describing cascading behaviors. In this paper,
  for general, marked Hawkes point processes, we present closed-form expressions for
  the mean and variance of future event counts, conditioned on observed events. Furthermore,
  these expressions allow us to develop a predictive approach, namely, Cascade Anytime
  Size Prediction via self-Exciting Regression model (CASPER), which is specifically
  tailored to popularity prediction, unlike existing generative approaches {–} based
  on point processes {–} for the same task. We showcase CASPER’s merits via experiments
  entailing both synthetic and real-world data, and demonstrate that it considerably
  improves upon prior works in terms of accuracy, especially for early-stage prediction.
