title: Investigating Why Contrastive Learning Benefits Robustness against Label Noise
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Self-supervised Contrastive Learning (CL) has been recently shown to be
  very effective in preventing deep networks from overfitting noisy labels. Despite
  its empirical success, the theoretical understanding of the effect of contrastive
  learning on boosting robustness is very limited. In this work, we rigorously prove
  that the representation matrix learned by contrastive learning boosts robustness,
  by having: (i) one prominent singular value corresponding to each sub-class in the
  data, and significantly smaller remaining singular values; and (ii) a large alignment
  between the prominent singular vectors and the clean labels of each sub-class. The
  above properties enable a linear layer trained on such representations to effectively
  learn the clean labels without overfitting the noise. We further show that the low-rank
  structure of the Jacobian of deep networks pre-trained with contrastive learning
  allows them to achieve a superior performance initially, when fine-tuned on noisy
  labels. Finally, we demonstrate that the initial robustness provided by contrastive
  learning enables robust training methods to achieve state-of-the-art performance
  under extreme noise levels, e.g., an average of 27.18% and 15.58% increase in accuracy
  on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with 80% symmetric noisy labels, and 4.11% increase in
  accuracy on WebVision.'
