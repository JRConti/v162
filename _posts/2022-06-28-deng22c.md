title: Deep Causal Metric Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Deep metric learning aims to learn distance metrics that measure similarities
  and dissimilarities between samples. The existing approaches typically focus on
  designing different hard sample mining or distance margin strategies and then minimize
  a pair/triplet-based or proxy-based loss over the training data. However, this can
  lead the model to recklessly learn all the correlated distances found in training
  data including the spurious distance (e.g., background differences) that is not
  the distance of interest and can harm the generalization of the learned metric.
  To address this issue, we study metric learning from a causality perspective and
  accordingly propose deep causal metric learning (DCML) that pursues the true causality
  of the distance between samples. DCML is achieved through explicitly learning environment-invariant
  attention and task-invariant embedding based on causal inference. Extensive experiments
  on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of DCML over the existing
  methods.
