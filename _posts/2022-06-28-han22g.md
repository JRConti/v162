title: Random Gegenbauer Features for Scalable Kernel Methods
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We propose efficient random features for approximating a new and rich class
  of kernel functions that we refer to as Generalized Zonal Kernels (GZK). Our proposed
  GZK family, generalizes the zonal kernels (i.e., dot-product kernels on the unit
  sphere) by introducing radial factors in the Gegenbauer series expansion of these
  kernel functions. The GZK class of kernels includes a wide range of ubiquitous kernel
  functions such as the entirety of dot-product kernels as well as the Gaussian and
  the recently introduced Neural Tangent kernels. Interestingly, by exploiting the
  reproducing property of the Gegenbauer (Zonal) Harmonics, we can construct efficient
  random features for the GZK family based on randomly oriented Gegenbauer harmonics.
  We prove subspace embedding guarantees for our Gegenbauer features which ensures
  that our features can be used for approximately solving learning problems such as
  kernel k-means clustering, kernel ridge regression, etc. Empirical results show
  that our proposed features outperform recent kernel approximation methods.
