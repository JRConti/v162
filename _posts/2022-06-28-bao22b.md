title: Fast Composite Optimization and Statistical Recovery in Federated Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: As a prevalent distributed learning paradigm, Federated Learning (FL) trains
  a global model on a massive amount of devices with infrequent communication. This
  paper investigates a class of composite optimization and statistical recovery problems
  in the FL setting, whose loss function consists of a data-dependent smooth loss
  and a non-smooth regularizer. Examples include sparse linear regression using Lasso,
  low-rank matrix recovery using nuclear norm regularization, etc. In the existing
  literature, federated composite optimization algorithms are designed only from an
  optimization perspective without any statistical guarantees. In addition, they do
  not consider commonly used (restricted) strong convexity in statistical recovery
  problems. We advance the frontiers of this problem from both optimization and statistical
  perspectives. From optimization upfront, we propose a new algorithm named <em>Fast
  Federated Dual Averaging</em> for strongly convex and smooth loss and establish
  state-of-the-art iteration and communication complexity in the composite setting.
  In particular, we prove that it enjoys a fast rate, linear speedup, and reduced
  communication rounds. From statistical upfront, for restricted strongly convex and
  smooth loss, we design another algorithm, namely <em>Multi-stage Federated Dual
  Averaging</em>, and prove a high probability complexity bound with linear speedup
  up to optimal statistical precision. Numerical experiments in both synthetic and
  real data demonstrate that our methods perform better than other baselines. To the
  best of our knowledge, this is the first work providing fast optimization algorithms
  and statistical recovery guarantees for composite problems in FL.
