title: Bayesian Deep Embedding Topic Meta-Learner
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Existing deep topic models are effective in capturing the latent semantic
  structures in textual data but usually rely on a plethora of documents. This is
  less than satisfactory in practical applications when only a limited amount of data
  is available. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that efficiently solves
  the problem of topic modeling under the small data regime. Specifically, the framework
  involves two innovations: a bi-level generative model that aims to exploit the task
  information to guide the document generation, and a topic meta-learner that strives
  to learn a group of global topic embeddings so that fast adaptation to the task-specific
  topic embeddings can be achieved with a few examples. We apply the proposed framework
  to a hierarchical embedded topic model and achieve better performance than various
  baseline models on diverse experiments, including few-shot topic discovery and few-shot
  document classification.'
