title: Stochastic Contextual Dueling Bandits under Linear Stochastic Transitivity
  Models
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We consider the regret minimization task in a dueling bandits problem with
  context information. In every round of the sequential decision problem, the learner
  makes a context-dependent selection of two choice alternatives (arms) to be compared
  with each other and receives feedback in the form of noisy preference information.
  We assume that the feedback process is determined by a linear stochastic transitivity
  model with contextualized utilities (CoLST), and the learner’s task is to include
  the best arm (with highest latent context-dependent utility) in the duel. We propose
  a computationally efficient algorithm, \Algo{CoLSTIM}, which makes its choice based
  on imitating the feedback process using perturbed context-dependent utility estimates
  of the underlying CoLST model. If each arm is associated with a $d$-dimensional
  feature vector, we show that \Algo{CoLSTIM} achieves a regret of order $\tilde O(
  \sqrt{dT})$ after $T$ learning rounds. Additionally, we also establish the optimality
  of \Algo{CoLSTIM} by showing a lower bound for the weak regret that refines the
  existing average regret analysis. Our experiments demonstrate its superiority over
  state-of-art algorithms for special cases of CoLST models.
