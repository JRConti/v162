title: Large Batch Experience Replay
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Several algorithms have been proposed to sample non-uniformly the replay
  buffer of deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents to speed-up learning, but very
  few theoretical foundations of these sampling schemes have been provided. Among
  others, Prioritized Experience Replay appears as a hyperparameter sensitive heuristic,
  even though it can provide good performance. In this work, we cast the replay buffer
  sampling problem as an importance sampling one for estimating the gradient. This
  allows deriving the theoretically optimal sampling distribution, yielding the best
  theoretical convergence speed. Elaborating on the knowledge of the ideal sampling
  scheme, we exhibit new theoretical foundations of Prioritized Experience Replay.
  The optimal sampling distribution being intractable, we make several approximations
  providing good results in practice and introduce, among others, LaBER (Large Batch
  Experience Replay), an easy-to-code and efficient method for sampling the replay
  buffer. LaBER, which can be combined with Deep Q-Networks, distributional RL agents
  or actor-critic methods, yields improved performance over a diverse range of Atari
  games and PyBullet environments, compared to the base agent it is implemented on
  and to other prioritization schemes.
