title: A Neural Tangent Kernel Perspective of GANs
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We propose a novel theoretical framework of analysis for Generative Adversarial
  Networks (GANs). We reveal a fundamental flaw of previous analyses which, by incorrectly
  modeling GANs’ training scheme, are subject to ill-defined discriminator gradients.
  We overcome this issue which impedes a principled study of GAN training, solving
  it within our framework by taking into account the discriminator’s architecture.
  To this end, we leverage the theory of infinite-width neural networks for the discriminator
  via its Neural Tangent Kernel. We characterize the trained discriminator for a wide
  range of losses and establish general differentiability properties of the network.
  From this, we derive new insights about the convergence of the generated distribution,
  advancing our understanding of GANs’ training dynamics. We empirically corroborate
  these results via an analysis toolkit based on our framework, unveiling intuitions
  that are consistent with GAN practice.
