title: Efficiently Learning the Topology and Behavior of a Networked Dynamical System
  Via Active Queries
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Using a discrete dynamical system model, many papers have addressed the
  problem of learning the behavior (i.e., the local function at each node) of a networked
  system through active queries, assuming that the network topology is known. We address
  the problem of inferring both the topology of the network and the behavior of a
  discrete dynamical system through active queries. We consider two query models studied
  in the literature, namely the batch model (where all the queries must be submitted
  together) and the adaptive model (where responses to previous queries can be used
  in formulating a new query). Our results are for systems where the state of each
  node is from {0,1} and the local functions are Boolean. We present algorithms to
  learn the topology and the behavior under both batch and adaptive query models for
  several classes of dynamical systems. These algorithms use only a polynomial number
  of queries. We also present experimental results obtained by running our query generation
  algorithms on synthetic and real-world networks.
