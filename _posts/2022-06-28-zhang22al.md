abstract: 'Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE) serves as one of the cornerstones in Reinforcement
  Learning (RL). Fitted Q Evaluation (FQE) with various function approximators, especially
  deep neural networks, has gained practical success. While statistical analysis has
  proved FQE to be minimax-optimal with tabular, linear and several nonparametric
  function families, its practical performance with more general function approximator
  is less theoretically understood. We focus on FQE with general <em>differentiable
  function approximators</em>, making our theory applicable to neural function approximations.
  We approach this problem using the Z-estimation theory and establish the following
  results: The FQE estimation error is asymptotically normal with explicit variance
  determined jointly by the tangent space of the function class at the ground truth,
  the reward structure, and the distribution shift due to off-policy learning; The
  finite-sample FQE error bound is dominated by the same variance term, and it can
  also be bounded by function class-dependent divergence, which measures how the off-policy
  distribution shift intertwines with the function approximator. In addition, we study
  bootstrapping FQE estimators for error distribution inference and estimating confidence
  intervals, accompanied by a Cramer-Rao lower bound that matches our upper bounds.
  The Z-estimation analysis provides a generalizable theoretical framework for studying
  off-policy estimation in RL and provides sharp statistical theory for FQE with differentiable
  function approximators.'
