title: 'ASAP.SGD: Instance-based Adaptiveness to Staleness in Asynchronous SGD'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Concurrent algorithmic implementations of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
  give rise to critical questions for compute-intensive Machine Learning (ML). Asynchrony
  implies speedup in some contexts, and challenges in others, as stale updates may
  lead to slower, or non-converging executions. While previous works showed asynchrony-adaptiveness
  can improve stability and speedup by reducing the step size for stale updates according
  to static rules, there is no one-size-fits-all adaptation rule, since the optimal
  strategy depends on several factors. We introduce (i) $\mathtt{ASAP.SGD}$, an analytical
  framework capturing necessary and desired properties of staleness-adaptive step
  size functions and (ii) \textsc{tail}-$\tau$, a method for utilizing key properties
  of the <em>execution instance</em>, generating a tailored strategy that not only
  dampens the impact of stale updates, but also leverages fresh ones. We recover convergence
  bounds for adaptiveness functions satisfying the $\mathtt{ASAP.SGD}$ conditions
  for general, convex and non-convex problems, and establish novel bounds for ones
  satisfying the Polyak-Lojasiewicz property. We evaluate \textsc{tail}-$\tau$ with
  representative <em>AsyncSGD</em> concurrent algorithms, for Deep Learning problems,
  showing \textsc{tail}-$\tau$ is a vital complement to <em>AsyncSGD</em>, with (i) persistent
  speedup in wall-clock convergence time in the parallelism spectrum, (ii) considerably
  lower risk of non-convergence, as well as (iii) precision levels for which original
  SGD implementations fail.
