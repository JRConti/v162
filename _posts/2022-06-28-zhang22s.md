title: Deep and Flexible Graph Neural Architecture Search
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been intensively applied to various graph-based
  applications. Despite their success, designing good GNN architectures is non-trivial,
  which heavily relies on lots of human efforts and domain knowledge. Although several
  attempts have been made in graph neural architecture search, they suffer from the
  following limitations: 1) fixed pipeline pattern of propagation (P) and (T) transformation
  operations; 2) restricted pipeline depth of GNN architectures. This paper proposes
  DFG-NAS, a novel method that searches for deep and flexible GNN architectures. Unlike
  most existing methods that focus on micro-architecture, DFG-NAS highlights another
  level of design: the search for macro-architectures of how atomic P and T are integrated
  and organized into a GNN. Concretely, DFG-NAS proposes a novel-designed search space
  for the P-T permutations and combinations based on the message-passing dis-aggregation,
  and defines various mutation strategies and employs the evolutionary algorithm to
  conduct an efficient and effective search. Empirical studies on four benchmark datasets
  demonstrate that DFG-NAS could find more powerful architectures than state-of-the-art
  manual designs and meanwhile are more efficient than the current graph neural architecture
  search approaches.'
