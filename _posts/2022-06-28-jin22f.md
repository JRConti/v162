title: Supervised Off-Policy Ranking
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) is to evaluate a target policy with data generated
  by other policies. Most previous OPE methods focus on precisely estimating the true
  performance of a policy. We observe that in many applications, (1) the end goal
  of OPE is to compare two or multiple candidate policies and choose a good one, which
  is a much simpler task than precisely evaluating their true performance; and (2)
  there are usually multiple policies that have been deployed to serve users in real-world
  systems and thus the true performance of these policies can be known. Inspired by
  the two observations, in this work, we study a new problem, supervised off-policy
  ranking (SOPR), which aims to rank a set of target policies based on supervised
  learning by leveraging off-policy data and policies with known performance. We propose
  a method to solve SOPR, which learns a policy scoring model by minimizing a ranking
  loss of the training policies rather than estimating the precise policy performance.
  The scoring model in our method, a hierarchical Transformer based model, maps a
  set of state-action pairs to a score, where the state of each pair comes from the
  off-policy data and the action is taken by a target policy on the state in an offline
  manner. Extensive experiments on public datasets show that our method outperforms
  baseline methods in terms of rank correlation, regret value, and stability. Our
  code is publicly available at GitHub.
