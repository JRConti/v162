booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We study the behavior of error bounds for multiclass classification under
  suitable margin conditions. For a wide variety of methods we prove that the classification
  error under a hard-margin condition decreases exponentially fast without any bias-variance
  trade-off. Different convergence rates can be obtained in correspondence of different
  margin assumptions. With a self-contained and instructive analysis we are able to
  generalize known results from the binary to the multiclass setting.
