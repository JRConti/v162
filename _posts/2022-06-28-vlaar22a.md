title: What Can Linear Interpolation of Neural Network Loss Landscapes Tell Us?
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Studying neural network loss landscapes provides insights into the nature
  of the underlying optimization problems. Unfortunately, loss landscapes are notoriously
  difficult to visualize in a human-comprehensible fashion. One common way to address
  this problem is to plot linear slices of the landscape, for example from the initial
  state of the network to the final state after optimization. On the basis of this
  analysis, prior work has drawn broader conclusions about the difficulty of the optimization
  problem. In this paper, we put inferences of this kind to the test, systematically
  evaluating how linear interpolation and final performance vary when altering the
  data, choice of initialization, and other optimizer and architecture design choices.
  Further, we use linear interpolation to study the role played by individual layers
  and substructures of the network. We find that certain layers are more sensitive
  to the choice of initialization, but that the shape of the linear path is not indicative
  of the changes in test accuracy of the model. Our results cast doubt on the broader
  intuition that the presence or absence of barriers when interpolating necessarily
  relates to the success of optimization.
