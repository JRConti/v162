title: 'Plan Your Target and Learn Your Skills: Transferable State-Only Imitation
  Learning via Decoupled Policy Optimization'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Recent progress in state-only imitation learning extends the scope of applicability
  of imitation learning to real-world settings by relieving the need for observing
  expert actions. However, existing solutions only learn to extract a state-to-action
  mapping policy from the data, without considering how the expert plans to the target.
  This hinders the ability to leverage demonstrations and limits the flexibility of
  the policy. In this paper, we introduce Decoupled Policy Optimization (DePO), which
  explicitly decouples the policy as a high-level state planner and an inverse dynamics
  model. With embedded decoupled policy gradient and generative adversarial training,
  DePO enables knowledge transfer to different action spaces or state transition dynamics,
  and can generalize the planner to out-of-demonstration state regions. Our in-depth
  experimental analysis shows the effectiveness of DePO on learning a generalized
  target state planner while achieving the best imitation performance. We demonstrate
  the appealing usage of DePO for transferring across different tasks by pre-training,
  and the potential for co-training agents with various skills.
