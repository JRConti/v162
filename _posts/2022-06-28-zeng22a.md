title: Multi Resolution Analysis (MRA) for Approximate Self-Attention
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Transformers have emerged as a preferred model for many tasks in natural
  langugage processing and vision. Recent efforts on training and deploying Transformers
  more efficiently have identified many strategies to approximate the self-attention
  matrix, a key module in a Transformer architecture. Effective ideas include various
  prespecified sparsity patterns, low-rank basis expansions and combinations thereof.
  In this paper, we revisit classical Multiresolution Analysis (MRA) concepts such
  as Wavelets, whose potential value in this setting remains underexplored thus far.
  We show that simple approximations based on empirical feedback and design choices
  informed by modern hardware and implementation challenges, eventually yield a MRA-based
  approach for self-attention with an excellent performance profile across most criteria
  of interest. We undertake an extensive set of experiments and demonstrate that this
  multi-resolution scheme outperforms most efficient self-attention proposals and
  is favorable for both short and long sequences. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/mlpen/mra-attention}.
