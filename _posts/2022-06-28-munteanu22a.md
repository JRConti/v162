title: Bounding the Width of Neural Networks via Coupled Initialization A Worst Case
  Analysis
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: A common method in training neural networks is to initialize all the weights
  to be independent Gaussian vectors. We observe that by instead initializing the
  weights into independent pairs, where each pair consists of two identical Gaussian
  vectors, we can significantly improve the convergence analysis. While a similar
  technique has been studied for random inputs [Daniely, NeurIPS 2020], it has not
  been analyzed with arbitrary inputs. Using this technique, we show how to significantly
  reduce the number of neurons required for two-layer ReLU networks, both in the under-parameterized
  setting with logistic loss, from roughly $\gamma^{-8}$ [Ji and Telgarsky, ICLR 2020]
  to $\gamma^{-2}$, where $\gamma$ denotes the separation margin with a Neural Tangent
  Kernel, as well as in the over-parameterized setting with squared loss, from roughly
  $n^4$ [Song and Yang, 2019] to $n^2$, implicitly also improving the recent running
  time bound of [Brand, Peng, Song and Weinstein, ITCS 2021]. For the under-parameterized
  setting we also prove new lower bounds that improve upon prior work, and that under
  certain assumptions, are best possible.
