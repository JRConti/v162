title: Improving Mini-batch Optimal Transport via Partial Transportation
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Mini-batch optimal transport (m-OT) has been widely used recently to deal
  with the memory issue of OT in large-scale applications. Despite their practicality,
  m-OT suffers from misspecified mappings, namely, mappings that are optimal on the
  mini-batch level but are partially wrong in the comparison with the optimal transportation
  plan between the original measures. Motivated by the misspecified mappings issue,
  we propose a novel mini-batch method by using partial optimal transport (POT) between
  mini-batch empirical measures, which we refer to as mini-batch partial optimal transport
  (m-POT). Leveraging the insight from the partial transportation, we explain the
  source of misspecified mappings from the m-OT and motivate why limiting the amount
  of transported masses among mini-batches via POT can alleviate the incorrect mappings.
  Finally, we carry out extensive experiments on various applications such as deep
  domain adaptation, partial domain adaptation, deep generative model, color transfer,
  and gradient flow to demonstrate the favorable performance of m-POT compared to
  current mini-batch methods.
