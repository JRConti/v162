title: Transformer Quality in Linear Time
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We revisit the design choices in Transformers, and propose methods to address
  their weaknesses in handling long sequences. First, we propose a simple layer named
  gated attention unit, which allows the use of a weaker single-head attention with
  minimal quality loss. We then propose a linear approximation method complementary
  to this new layer, which is accelerator-friendly and highly competitive in quality.
  The resulting model, named FLASH, matches the perplexity of improved Transformers
  over both short (512) and long (8K) context lengths, achieving training speedups
  of up to 4.9x on Wiki-40B and 12.1x on PG-19 for auto-regressive language modeling,
  and 4.8x on C4 for masked language modeling.
