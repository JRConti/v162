title: Stochastic Deep Networks with Linear Competing Units for Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'This work addresses meta-learning (ML) by considering deep networks with
  stochastic local winner-takes-all (LWTA) activations. This type of network units
  results in sparse representations from each model layer, as the units are organized
  into blocks where only one unit generates a non-zero output. The main operating
  principle of the introduced units rely on stochastic principles, as the network
  performs posterior sampling over competing units to select the winner. Therefore,
  the proposed networks are explicitly designed to extract input data representations
  of sparse stochastic nature, as opposed to the currently standard deterministic
  representation paradigm. Our approach produces state-of-the-art predictive accuracy
  on few-shot image classification and regression experiments, as well as reduced
  predictive error on an active learning setting; these improvements come with an
  immensely reduced computational cost. Code is available at: https://github.com/Kkalais/StochLWTA-ML'
