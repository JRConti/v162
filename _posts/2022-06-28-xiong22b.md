title: A Self-Play Posterior Sampling Algorithm for Zero-Sum Markov Games
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Existing studies on provably efficient algorithms for Markov games (MGs)
  almost exclusively build on the “optimism in the face of uncertainty” (OFU) principle.
  This work focuses on a distinct approach of posterior sampling, which is celebrated
  in many bandits and reinforcement learning settings but remains under-explored for
  MGs. Specifically, for episodic two-player zero-sum MGs, a novel posterior sampling
  algorithm is developed with <em>general</em> function approximation. Theoretical
  analysis demonstrates that the posterior sampling algorithm admits a $\sqrt{T}$-regret
  bound for problems with a low multi-agent decoupling coefficient, which is a new
  complexity measure for MGs, where $T$ denotes the number of episodes. When specializing
  to linear MGs, the obtained regret bound matches the state-of-the-art results. To
  the best of our knowledge, this is the first provably efficient posterior sampling
  algorithm for MGs with frequentist regret guarantees, which extends the toolbox
  for MGs and promotes the broad applicability of posterior sampling.
