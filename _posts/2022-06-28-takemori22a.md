title: Distributionally-Aware Kernelized Bandit Problems for Risk Aversion
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The kernelized bandit problem is a theoretically justified framework and
  has solid applications to various fields. Recently, there is a growing interest
  in generalizing the problem to the optimization of risk-averse metrics such as Conditional
  Value-at-Risk (CVaR) or Mean-Variance (MV). However, due to the model assumption,
  most existing methods need explicit design of environment random variables and can
  incur large regret because of possible high dimensionality of them. To address the
  issues, in this paper, we model environments using a family of the output distributions
  (or more precisely, probability kernel) and Kernel Mean Embeddings (KME), and provide
  novel UCB-type algorithms for CVaR and MV. Moreover, we provide algorithm-independent
  lower bounds for CVaR in the case of Mat√©rn kernels, and propose a nearly optimal
  algorithm. Furthermore, we empirically verify our theoretical result in synthetic
  environments, and demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms
  a baseline in many cases.
