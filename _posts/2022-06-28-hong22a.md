title: Deep Hierarchy in Bandits
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Mean rewards of actions are often correlated. The form of these correlations
  may be complex and unknown a priori, such as the preferences of users for recommended
  products and their categories. To maximize statistical efficiency, it is important
  to leverage these correlations when learning. We formulate a bandit variant of this
  problem where the correlations of mean action rewards are represented by a hierarchical
  Bayesian model with latent variables. Since the hierarchy can have multiple layers,
  we call it deep. We propose a hierarchical Thompson sampling algorithm (HierTS)
  for this problem and show how to implement it efficiently for Gaussian hierarchies.
  The efficient implementation is possible due to a novel exact hierarchical representation
  of the posterior, which itself is of independent interest. We use this exact posterior
  to analyze the Bayes regret of HierTS. Our regret bounds reflect the structure of
  the problem, that the regret decreases with more informative priors, and can be
  recast to highlight reduced dependence on the number of actions. We confirm these
  theoretical findings empirically, in both synthetic and real-world experiments.
