title: 'G$^2$CN: Graph Gaussian Convolution Networks with Concentrated Graph Filters'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Recently, linear GCNs have shown competitive performance against non-linear
  ones with less computation cost, and the key lies in their propagation layers. Spectral
  analysis has been widely adopted in designing and analyzing existing graph propagations.
  Nevertheless, we notice that existing spectral analysis fails to explain why existing
  graph propagations with the same global tendency, such as low-pass or high-pass,
  still yield very different results. Motivated by this situation, we develop a new
  framework for spectral analysis in this paper called concentration analysis. In
  particular, we propose three attributes: concentration centre, maximum response,
  and bandwidth for our analysis. Through a dissection of the limitations of existing
  graph propagations via the above analysis, we propose a new kind of propagation
  layer, Graph Gaussian Convolution Networks (G^2CN), in which the three properties
  are decoupled and the whole structure becomes more flexible and applicable to different
  kinds of graphs. Extensive experiments show that we can obtain state-of-the-art
  performance on heterophily and homophily datasets with our proposed G^2CN.'
