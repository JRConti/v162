title: Hermite Polynomial Features for Private Data Generation
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Kernel mean embedding is a useful tool to compare probability measures.
  Despite its usefulness, kernel mean embedding considers infinite-dimensional features,
  which are challenging to handle in the context of differentially private data generation.
  A recent work, DP-MERF (Harder et al., 2021), proposes to approximate the kernel
  mean embedding of data distribution using finite-dimensional random features, which
  yields an analytically tractable sensitivity of approximate kernel mean embedding.
  However, the required number of random features in DP-MERF is excessively high,
  often ten thousand to a hundred thousand, which worsens the sensitivity of the approximate
  kernel mean embedding. To improve the sensitivity, we propose to replace random
  features with Hermite polynomial features. Unlike the random features, the Hermite
  polynomial features are ordered, where the features at the low orders contain more
  information on the distribution than those at the high orders. Hence, a relatively
  low order of Hermite polynomial features can more accurately approximate the mean
  embedding of the data distribution compared to a significantly higher number of
  random features. As a result, the Hermite polynomial features help us to improve
  the privacy-accuracy trade-off compared to DP-MERF, as demonstrated on several heterogeneous
  tabular datasets, as well as several image benchmark datasets.
