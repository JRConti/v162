title: Metric-Fair Classifier Derandomization
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'We study the problem of <em>classifier derandomization</em> in machine
  learning: given a stochastic binary classifier $f: X \to [0,1]$, sample a deterministic
  classifier $\hat{f}: X \to \{0,1\}$ that approximates the output of $f$ in aggregate
  over any data distribution. Recent work revealed how to efficiently derandomize
  a stochastic classifier with strong output approximation guarantees, but at the
  cost of individual fairness — that is, if $f$ treated similar inputs similarly,
  $\hat{f}$ did not. In this paper, we initiate a systematic study of classifier derandomization
  with metric fairness guarantees. We show that the prior derandomization approach
  is almost maximally metric-unfair, and that a simple “random threshold” derandomization
  achieves optimal fairness preservation but with weaker output approximation. We
  then devise a derandomization procedure that provides an appealing tradeoff between
  these two: if $f$ is $\alpha$-metric fair according to a metric $d$ with a locality-sensitive
  hash (LSH) family, then our derandomized $\hat{f}$ is, with high probability, $O(\alpha)$-metric
  fair and a close approximation of $f$. We also prove generic results applicable
  to all (fair and unfair) classifier derandomization procedures, including a bias-variance
  decomposition and reductions between various notions of metric fairness.'
