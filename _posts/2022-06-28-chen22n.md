title: 'ME-GAN: Learning Panoptic Electrocardio Representations for Multi-view ECG
  Synthesis Conditioned on Heart Diseases'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely used non-invasive diagnostic tool for
  heart diseases. Many studies have devised ECG analysis models (e.g., classifiers)
  to assist diagnosis. As an upstream task, researches have built generative models
  to synthesize ECG data, which are beneficial to providing training samples, privacy
  protection, and annotation reduction. However, previous generative methods for ECG
  often neither synthesized multi-view data, nor dealt with heart disease conditions.
  In this paper, we propose a novel disease-aware generative adversarial network for
  multi-view ECG synthesis called ME-GAN, which attains panoptic electrocardio representations
  conditioned on heart diseases and projects the representations onto multiple standard
  views to yield ECG signals. Since ECG manifestations of heart diseases are often
  localized in specific waveforms, we propose a new "mixup normalization" to inject
  disease information precisely into suitable locations. In addition, we propose a
  "view discriminator" to revert disordered ECG views into a pre-determined order,
  supervising the generator to obtain ECG representing correct view characteristics.
  Besides, a new metric, rFID, is presented to assess the quality of the synthesized
  ECG signals. Comprehensive experiments verify that our ME-GAN performs well on multi-view
  ECG signal synthesis with trusty morbid manifestations.
