title: A Differential Entropy Estimator for Training Neural Networks
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Mutual Information (MI) has been widely used as a loss regularizer for training
  neural networks. This has been particularly effective when learn disentangled or
  compressed representations of high dimensional data. However, differential entropy
  (DE), another fundamental measure of information, has not found widespread use in
  neural network training. Although DE offers a potentially wider range of applications
  than MI, off-the-shelf DE estimators are either non differentiable, computationally
  intractable or fail to adapt to changes in the underlying distribution. These drawbacks
  prevent them from being used as regularizers in neural networks training. To address
  shortcomings in previously proposed estimators for DE, here we introduce KNIFE,
  a fully parameterized, differentiable kernel-based estimator of DE. The flexibility
  of our approach also allows us to construct KNIFE-based estimators for conditional
  (on either discrete or continuous variables) DE, as well as MI. We empirically validate
  our method on high-dimensional synthetic data and further apply it to guide the
  training of neural networks for real-world tasks. Our experiments on a large variety
  of tasks, including visual domain adaptation, textual fair classification, and textual
  fine-tuning demonstrate the effectiveness of KNIFE-based estimation. Code can be
  found at https://github.com/g-pichler/knife.
