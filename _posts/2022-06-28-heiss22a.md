title: 'NOMU: Neural Optimization-based Model Uncertainty'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We study methods for estimating model uncertainty for neural networks (NNs)
  in regression. To isolate the effect of model uncertainty, we focus on a noiseless
  setting with scarce training data. We introduce five important desiderata regarding
  model uncertainty that any method should satisfy. However, we find that established
  benchmarks often fail to reliably capture some of these desiderata, even those that
  are required by Bayesian theory. To address this, we introduce a new approach for
  capturing model uncertainty for NNs, which we call Neural Optimization-based Model
  Uncertainty (NOMU). The main idea of NOMU is to design a network architecture consisting
  of two connected sub-NNs, one for model prediction and one for model uncertainty,
  and to train it using a carefully-designed loss function. Importantly, our design
  enforces that NOMU satisfies our five desiderata. Due to its modular architecture,
  NOMU can provide model uncertainty for any given (previously trained) NN if given
  access to its training data. We evaluate NOMU in various regressions tasks and noiseless
  Bayesian optimization (BO) with costly evaluations. In regression, NOMU performs
  at least as well as state-of-the-art methods. In BO, NOMU even outperforms all considered
  benchmarks.
