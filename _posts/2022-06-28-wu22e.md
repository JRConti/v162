title: Instrumental Variable Regression with Confounder Balancing
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: This paper considers the challenge of estimating treatment effects from
  observational data in the presence of unmeasured confounders. A popular way to address
  this challenge is to utilize an instrumental variable (IV) for two-stage regression,
  i.e., 2SLS and variants, but limited to the linear setting. Recently, many nonlinear
  IV regression variants were proposed to overcome it by regressing the treatment
  with IVs and observed confounders in stage 1, leading to the imbalance of the observed
  confounders in stage 2. In this paper, we propose a Confounder Balanced IV Regression
  (CB-IV) algorithm to jointly remove the bias from the unmeasured confounders and
  balance the observed confounders. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
  work to combine confounder balancing in IV regression for treatment effect estimation.
  Theoretically, we re-define and solve the inverse problems for the response-outcome
  function. Experiments show that our algorithm outperforms the existing approaches.
