title: Nested Bandits
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In many online decision processes, the optimizing agent is called to choose
  between large numbers of alternatives with many inherent similarities; in turn,
  these similarities imply closely correlated losses that may confound standard discrete
  choice models and bandit algorithms. We study this question in the context of nested
  bandits, a class of adversarial multi-armed bandit problems where the learner seeks
  to minimize their regret in the presence of a large number of distinct alternatives
  with a hierarchy of embedded (non-combinatorial) similarities. In this setting,
  optimal algorithms based on the exponential weights blueprint (like Hedge, EXP3,
  and their variants) may incur significant regret because they tend to spend excessive
  amounts of time exploring irrelevant alternatives with similar, suboptimal costs.
  To account for this, we propose a nested exponential weights (NEW) algorithm that
  performs a layered exploration of the learner’s set of alternatives based on a nested,
  step-by-step selection method. In so doing, we obtain a series of tight bounds for
  the learner’s regret showing that online learning problems with a high degree of
  similarity between alternatives can be resolved efficiently, without a red bus /
  blue bus paradox occurring.
