title: Sample Efficient Learning of Predictors that Complement Humans
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: One of the goals of learning algorithms is to complement and reduce the
  burden on human decision makers. The expert deferral setting wherein an algorithm
  can either predict on its own or defer the decision to a downstream expert helps
  accomplish this goal. A fundamental aspect of this setting is the need to learn
  complementary predictors that improve on the humanâ€™s weaknesses rather than learning
  predictors optimized for average error. In this work, we provide the first theoretical
  analysis of the benefit of learning complementary predictors in expert deferral.
  To enable efficiently learning such predictors, we consider a family of consistent
  surrogate loss functions for expert deferral and analyze their theoretical properties.
  Finally, we design active learning schemes that require minimal amount of data of
  human expert predictions in order to learn accurate deferral systems.
