title: Feature Learning and Signal Propagation in Deep Neural Networks
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Recent work by Baratin et al. (2021) sheds light on an intriguing pattern
  that occurs during the training of deep neural networks: some layers align much
  more with data compared to other layers (where the alignment is defined as the normalize
  euclidean product of the tangent features matrix and the data labels matrix). The
  curve of the alignment as a function of layer index (generally) exhibits a ascent-descent
  pattern where the maximum is reached for some hidden layer. In this work, we provide
  the first explanation for this phenomenon. We introduce the Equilibrium Hypothesis
  which connects this alignment pattern to signal propagation in deep neural networks.
  Our experiments demonstrate an excellent match with the theoretical predictions.'
