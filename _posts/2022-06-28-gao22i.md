title: Fast and Reliable Evaluation of Adversarial Robustness with Minimum-Margin
  Attack
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The AutoAttack (AA) has been the most reliable method to evaluate adversarial
  robustness when considerable computational resources are available. However, the
  high computational cost (e.g., 100 times more than that of the project gradient
  descent attack) makes AA infeasible for practitioners with limited computational
  resources, and also hinders applications of AA in the adversarial training (AT).
  In this paper, we propose a novel method, minimum-margin (MM) attack, to fast and
  reliably evaluate adversarial robustness. Compared with AA, our method achieves
  comparable performance but only costs 3% of the computational time in extensive
  experiments. The reliability of our method lies in that we evaluate the quality
  of adversarial examples using the margin between two targets that can precisely
  identify the most adversarial example. The computational efficiency of our method
  lies in an effective Sequential TArget Ranking Selection (STARS) method, ensuring
  that the cost of the MM attack is independent of the number of classes. The MM attack
  opens a new way for evaluating adversarial robustness and provides a feasible and
  reliable way to generate high-quality adversarial examples in AT.
