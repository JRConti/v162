title: Implicit Regularization in Hierarchical Tensor Factorization and Deep Convolutional
  Neural Networks
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In the pursuit of explaining implicit regularization in deep learning, prominent
  focus was given to matrix and tensor factorizations, which correspond to simplified
  neural networks. It was shown that these models exhibit an implicit tendency towards
  low matrix and tensor ranks, respectively. Drawing closer to practical deep learning,
  the current paper theoretically analyzes the implicit regularization in hierarchical
  tensor factorization, a model equivalent to certain deep convolutional neural networks.
  Through a dynamical systems lens, we overcome challenges associated with hierarchy,
  and establish implicit regularization towards low hierarchical tensor rank. This
  translates to an implicit regularization towards locality for the associated convolutional
  networks. Inspired by our theory, we design explicit regularization discouraging
  locality, and demonstrate its ability to improve the performance of modern convolutional
  networks on non-local tasks, in defiance of conventional wisdom by which architectural
  changes are needed. Our work highlights the potential of enhancing neural networks
  via theoretical analysis of their implicit regularization.
