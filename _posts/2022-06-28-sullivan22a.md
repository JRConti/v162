title: 'Cliff Diving: Exploring Reward Surfaces in Reinforcement Learning Environments'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Visualizing optimization landscapes has resulted in many fundamental insights
  in numeric optimization, specifically regarding novel improvements to optimization
  techniques. However, visualizations of the objective that reinforcement learning
  optimizes (the "reward surface") have only ever been generated for a small number
  of narrow contexts. This work presents reward surfaces and related visualizations
  of 27 of the most widely used reinforcement learning environments in Gym for the
  first time. We also explore reward surfaces in the policy gradient direction and
  show for the first time that many popular reinforcement learning environments have
  frequent "cliffs" (sudden large drops in expected reward). We demonstrate that A2C
  often "dives off" these cliffs into low reward regions of the parameter space while
  PPO avoids them, confirming a popular intuition for PPOâ€™s improved performance over
  previous methods. We additionally introduce a highly extensible library that allows
  researchers to easily generate these visualizations in the future. Our findings
  provide new intuition to explain the successes and failures of modern RL methods,
  and our visualizations concretely characterize several failure modes of reinforcement
  learning agents in novel ways.
