title: Causal Imitation Learning under Temporally Correlated Noise
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We develop algorithms for imitation learning from policy data that was corrupted
  by temporally correlated noise in expert actions. When noise affects multiple timesteps
  of recorded data, it can manifest as spurious correlations between states and actions
  that a learner might latch on to, leading to poor policy performance. To break up
  these spurious correlations, we apply modern variants of the instrumental variable
  regression (IVR) technique of econometrics, enabling us to recover the underlying
  policy without requiring access to an interactive expert. In particular, we present
  two techniques, one of a generative-modeling flavor (DoubIL) that can utilize access
  to a simulator, and one of a game-theoretic flavor (ResiduIL) that can be run entirely
  offline. We find both of our algorithms compare favorably to behavioral cloning
  on simulated control tasks.
