title: Generalizing to New Physical Systems via Context-Informed Dynamics Model
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Data-driven approaches to modeling physical systems fail to generalize to
  unseen systems that share the same general dynamics with the learning domain, but
  correspond to different physical contexts. We propose a new framework for this key
  problem, context-informed dynamics adaptation (CoDA), which takes into account the
  distributional shift across systems for fast and efficient adaptation to new dynamics.
  CoDA leverages multiple environments, each associated to a different dynamic, and
  learns to condition the dynamics model on contextual parameters, specific to each
  environment. The conditioning is performed via a hypernetwork, learned jointly with
  a context vector from observed data. The proposed formulation constrains the search
  hypothesis space for fast adaptation and better generalization across environments
  with few samples. We theoretically motivate our approach and show state-of-the-art
  generalization results on a set of nonlinear dynamics, representative of a variety
  of application domains. We also show, on these systems, that new system parameters
  can be inferred from context vectors with minimal supervision.
