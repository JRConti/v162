abstract: 'Although learning in high dimensions is commonly believed to suffer from
  the curse of dimensionality, modern machine learning methods often exhibit an astonishing
  power to tackle a wide range of challenging real-world learning problems without
  using abundant amounts of data. How exactly these methods break this curse remains
  a fundamental open question in the theory of deep learning. While previous efforts
  have investigated this question by studying the data ($\mathcal D$), model ($\mathcal
  M$), and inference algorithm ($\mathcal I$) as independent modules, in this paper
  we analyzes the triplet $(\mathcal D, \mathcal M, \mathcal I)$ as an integrated
  system and identify important synergies that help mitigate the curse of dimensionality.
  We first study the basic symmetries associated with various learning algorithms
  ($\mathcal M, \mathcal I$), focusing on four prototypical architectures in deep
  learning: fully-connected networks, locally-connected networks, and convolutional
  networks with and without pooling. We find that learning is most efficient when
  these symmetries are compatible with those of the data distribution and that performance
  significantly deteriorates when any member of the \dmi triplet is inconsistent or
  suboptimal.'
