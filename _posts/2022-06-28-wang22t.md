title: Iterative Double Sketching for Faster Least-Squares Optimization
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: This work is concerned with the overdetermined linear least-squares problem
  for large scale data. We generalize the iterative Hessian sketching (IHS) algorithm
  and propose a new sketching framework named iterative double sketching (IDS) which
  uses approximations for both the gradient and the Hessian in each iteration. To
  understand the behavior of the IDS algorithm and choose the optimal hyperparameters,
  we derive the exact limit of the conditional prediction error of the IDS algorithm
  in the setting of Gaussian sketching. Guided by this theoretical result, we propose
  an efficient IDS algorithm via a new class of sequentially related sketching matrices.
  We give a non-asymptotic analysis of this efficient IDS algorithm which shows that
  the proposed algorithm achieves the state-of-the-art trade-off between accuracy
  and efficiency.
