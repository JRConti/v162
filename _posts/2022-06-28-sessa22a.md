  Computation
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We consider model-based multi-agent reinforcement learning, where the environment
  transition model is unknown and can only be learned via expensive interactions with
  the environment. We propose H-MARL (Hallucinated Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning),
  a novel sample-efficient algorithm that can efficiently balance exploration, i.e.,
  learning about the environment, and exploitation, i.e., achieve good equilibrium
  performance in the underlying general-sum Markov game. H-MARL builds high-probability
  confidence intervals around the unknown transition model and sequentially updates
  them based on newly observed data. Using these, it constructs an optimistic hallucinated
  game for the agents for which equilibrium policies are computed at each round. We
  consider general statistical models (e.g., Gaussian processes, deep ensembles, etc.)
  and policy classes (e.g., deep neural networks), and theoretically analyze our approach
  by bounding the agentsâ€™ dynamic regret. Moreover, we provide a convergence rate
  to the equilibria of the underlying Markov game. We demonstrate our approach experimentally
  on an autonomous driving simulation benchmark. H-MARL learns successful equilibrium
  policies after a few interactions with the environment and can significantly improve
  the performance compared to non-optimistic exploration methods.
