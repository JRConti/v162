title: Volatility Based Kernels and Moving Average Means for Accurate Forecasting
  with Gaussian Processes
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: A broad class of stochastic volatility models are defined by systems of
  stochastic differential equations, and while these models have seen widespread success
  in domains such as finance and statistical climatology, they typically lack an ability
  to condition on historical data to produce a true posterior distribution. To address
  this fundamental limitation, we show how to re-cast a class of stochastic volatility
  models as a hierarchical Gaussian process (GP) model with specialized covariance
  functions. This GP model retains the inductive biases of the stochastic volatility
  model while providing the posterior predictive distribution given by GP inference.
  Within this framework, we take inspiration from well studied domains to introduce
  a new class of models, Volt and Magpie, that significantly outperform baselines
  in stock and wind speed forecasting, and naturally extend to the multitask setting.
