title: Fast rates for noisy interpolation require rethinking the effect of inductive
  bias
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Good generalization performance on high-dimensional data crucially hinges
  on a simple structure of the ground truth and a corresponding strong inductive bias
  of the estimator. Even though this intuition is valid for regularized models, in
  this paper we caution against a strong inductive bias for interpolation in the presence
  of noise: While a stronger inductive bias encourages a simpler structure that is
  more aligned with the ground truth, it also increases the detrimental effect of
  noise. Specifically, for both linear regression and classification with a sparse
  ground truth, we prove that minimum $\ell_p$-norm and maximum $\ell_p$-margin interpolators
  achieve fast polynomial rates close to order $1/n$ for $p > 1$ compared to a logarithmic
  rate for $p = 1$. Finally, we provide preliminary experimental evidence that this
  trade-off may also play a crucial role in understanding non-linear interpolating
  models used in practice.'
