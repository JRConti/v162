title: Sublinear-Time Clustering Oracle for Signed Graphs
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Social networks are often modeled using signed graphs, where vertices correspond
  to users and edges have a sign that indicates whether an interaction between users
  was positive or negative. The arising signed graphs typically contain a clear community
  structure in the sense that the graph can be partitioned into a small number of
  polarized communities, each defining a sparse cut and indivisible into smaller polarized
  sub-communities. We provide a local clustering oracle for signed graphs with such
  a clear community structure, that can answer membership queries, i.e., “Given a
  vertex $v$, which community does $v$ belong to?”, in sublinear time by reading only
  a small portion of the graph. Formally, when the graph has bounded maximum degree
  and the number of communities is at most $O(\log n)$, then with $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n}\operatorname{poly}(1/\varepsilon))$
  preprocessing time, our oracle can answer each membership query in $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n}\operatorname{poly}(1/\varepsilon))$
  time, and it correctly classifies a $(1-\varepsilon)$-fraction of vertices w.r.t.
  a set of hidden planted ground-truth communities. Our oracle is desirable in applications
  where the clustering information is needed for only a small number of vertices.
  Previously, such local clustering oracles were only known for unsigned graphs; our
  generalization to signed graphs requires a number of new ideas and gives a novel
  spectral analysis of the behavior of random walks with signs. We evaluate our algorithm
  for constructing such an oracle and answering membership queries on both synthetic
  and real-world datasets, validating its performance in practice.
