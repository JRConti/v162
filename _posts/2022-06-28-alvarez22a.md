title: Minimax Classification under Concept Drift with Multidimensional Adaptation
  and Performance Guarantees
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The statistical characteristics of instance-label pairs often change with
  time in practical scenarios of supervised classification. Conventional learning
  techniques adapt to such concept drift accounting for a scalar rate of change by
  means of a carefully chosen learning rate, forgetting factor, or window size. However,
  the time changes in common scenarios are multidimensional, i.e., different statistical
  characteristics often change in a different manner. This paper presents adaptive
  minimax risk classifiers (AMRCs) that account for multidimensional time changes
  by means of a multivariate and high-order tracking of the time-varying underlying
  distribution. In addition, differently from conventional techniques, AMRCs can provide
  computable tight performance guarantees. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
  show the classification improvement of AMRCs compared to the state-of-the-art and
  the reliability of the presented performance guarantees.
