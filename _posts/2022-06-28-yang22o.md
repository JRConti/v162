title: Fourier Learning with Cyclical Data
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Many machine learning models for online applications, such as recommender
  systems, are often trained on data with cyclical properties. These data sequentially
  arrive from a time-varying distribution that is periodic in time. Existing algorithms
  either use streaming learning to track a time-varying set of optimal model parameters,
  yielding a dynamic regret that scales linearly in time; or partition the data of
  each cycle into multiple segments and train a separate model for each—a pluralistic
  approach that is computationally and storage-wise expensive. In this paper, we have
  designed a novel approach to overcome the aforementioned shortcomings. Our method,
  named "Fourier learning", encodes the periodicity into the model representation
  using a partial Fourier sequence, and trains the coefficient functions modeled by
  neural networks. Particularly, we design a Fourier multi-layer perceptron (F-MLP)
  that can be trained on streaming data with stochastic gradient descent (streaming-SGD),
  and we derive its convergence guarantees. We demonstrate Fourier learning’s better
  performance with extensive experiments on synthetic and public datasets, as well
  as on a large-scale recommender system that is updated in real-time, and trained
  with tens of millions of samples per day.
