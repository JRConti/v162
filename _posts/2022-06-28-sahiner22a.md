  Transformers'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Vision transformers using self-attention or its proposed alternatives have
  demonstrated promising results in many image related tasks. However, the underpinning
  inductive bias of attention is not well understood. To address this issue, this
  paper analyzes attention through the lens of convex duality. For the non-linear
  dot-product self-attention, and alternative mechanisms such as MLP-mixer and Fourier
  Neural Operator (FNO), we derive equivalent finite-dimensional convex problems that
  are interpretable and solvable to global optimality. The convex programs lead to
  block nuclear-norm regularization that promotes low rank in the latent feature and
  token dimensions. In particular, we show how self-attention networks implicitly
  clusters the tokens, based on their latent similarity. We conduct experiments for
  transferring a pre-trained transformer backbone for CIFAR-100 classification by
  fine-tuning a variety of convex attention heads. The results indicate the merits
  of the bias induced by attention compared with the existing MLP or linear heads.
