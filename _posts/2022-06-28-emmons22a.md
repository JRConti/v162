title: For Learning in Symmetric Teams, Local Optima are Global Nash Equilibria
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Although it has been known since the 1970s that a <em>globally</em> optimal
  strategy profile in a common-payoff game is a Nash equilibrium, global optimality
  is a strict requirement that limits the resultâ€™s applicability. In this work, we
  show that any <em>locally</em> optimal symmetric strategy profile is also a (global)
  Nash equilibrium. Furthermore, we show that this result is robust to perturbations
  to the common payoff and to the local optimum. Applied to machine learning, our
  result provides a global guarantee for any gradient method that finds a local optimum
  in symmetric strategy space. While this result indicates stability to <em>unilateral</em>
  deviation, we nevertheless identify broad classes of games where mixed local optima
  are unstable under <em>joint</em>, asymmetric deviations. We analyze the prevalence
  of instability by running learning algorithms in a suite of symmetric games, and
  we conclude by discussing the applicability of our results to multi-agent RL, cooperative
  inverse RL, and decentralized POMDPs.
