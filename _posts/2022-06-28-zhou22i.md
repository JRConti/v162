title: Approximate Frank-Wolfe Algorithms over Graph-structured Support Sets
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In this paper, we consider approximate Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithms to solve
  convex optimization problems over graph-structured support sets where the linear
  minimization oracle (LMO) cannot be efficiently obtained in general. We first demonstrate
  that two popular approximation assumptions (additive and multiplicative gap errors)
  are not applicable in that no cheap gap-approximate LMO oracle exists. Thus, approximate
  dual maximization oracles (DMO) are proposed, which approximate the inner product
  rather than the gap. We prove that the standard FW method using a $\delta$-approximate
  DMO converges as $O((1-\delta) \sqrt{s}/\delta)$ in the worst case, and as $O(L/(\delta^2
  t))$ over a $\delta$-relaxation of the constraint set. Furthermore, when the solution
  is on the boundary, a variant of FW converges as $O(1/t^2)$ under the quadratic
  growth assumption. Our empirical results suggest that even these improved bounds
  are pessimistic, showing fast convergence in recovering real-world images with graph-structured
  sparsity.
