title: Inducing Causal Structure for Interpretable Neural Networks
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In many areas, we have well-founded insights about causal structure that
  would be useful to bring into our trained models while still allowing them to learn
  in a data-driven fashion. To achieve this, we present the new method of interchange
  intervention training (IIT). In IIT, we (1) align variables in a causal model (e.g.,
  a deterministic program or Bayesian network) with representations in a neural model
  and (2) train the neural model to match the counterfactual behavior of the causal
  model on a base input when aligned representations in both models are set to be
  the value they would be for a source input. IIT is fully differentiable, flexibly
  combines with other objectives, and guarantees that the target causal model is a
  causal abstraction of the neural model when its loss is zero. We evaluate IIT on
  a structural vision task (MNIST-PVR), a navigational language task (ReaSCAN), and
  a natural language inference task (MQNLI). We compare IIT against multi-task training
  objectives and data augmentation. In all our experiments, IIT achieves the best
  results and produces neural models that are more interpretable in the sense that
  they more successfully realize the target causal model.
