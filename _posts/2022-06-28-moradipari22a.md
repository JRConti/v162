title: Feature and Parameter Selection in Stochastic Linear Bandits
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We study two model selection settings in stochastic linear bandits (LB).
  In the first setting, which we refer to as feature selection, the expected reward
  of the LB problem is in the linear span of at least one of $M$ feature maps (models).
  In the second setting, the reward parameter of the LB problem is arbitrarily selected
  from $M$ models represented as (possibly) overlapping balls in $\mathbb R^d$. However,
  the agent only has access to misspecified models, i.e., estimates of the centers
  and radii of the balls. We refer to this setting as parameter selection. For each
  setting, we develop and analyze a computationally efficient algorithm that is based
  on a reduction from bandits to full-information problems. This allows us to obtain
  regret bounds that are not worse (up to a $\sqrt{\log M}$ factor) than the case
  where the true model is known. This is the best reported dependence on the number
  of models $M$ in these settings. Finally, we empirically show the effectiveness
  of our algorithms using synthetic and real-world experiments.
