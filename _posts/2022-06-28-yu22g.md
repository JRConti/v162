title: 'GraphFM: Improving Large-Scale GNN Training via Feature Momentum'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Training of graph neural networks (GNNs) for large-scale node classification
  is challenging. A key difficulty lies in obtaining accurate hidden node representations
  while avoiding the neighborhood explosion problem. Here, we propose a new technique,
  named feature momentum (FM), that uses a momentum step to incorporate historical
  embeddings when updating feature representations. We develop two specific algorithms,
  known as GraphFM-IB and GraphFM-OB, that consider in-batch and out-of-batch data,
  respectively. GraphFM-IB applies FM to in-batch sampled data, while GraphFM-OB applies
  FM to out-of-batch data that are 1-hop neighborhood of in-batch data. We provide
  a convergence analysis for GraphFM-IB and some theoretical insight for GraphFM-OB.
  Empirically, we observe that GraphFM-IB can effectively alleviate the neighborhood
  explosion problem of existing methods. In addition, GraphFM-OB achieves promising
  performance on multiple large-scale graph datasets.
