title: Benchmarking and Analyzing Point Cloud Classification under Corruptions
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 3D perception, especially point cloud classification, has achieved substantial
  progress. However, in real-world deployment, point cloud corruptions are inevitable
  due to the scene complexity, sensor inaccuracy, and processing imprecision. In this
  work, we aim to rigorously benchmark and analyze point cloud classification under
  corruptions. To conduct a systematic investigation, we first provide a taxonomy
  of common 3D corruptions and identify the atomic corruptions. Then, we perform a
  comprehensive evaluation on a wide range of representative point cloud models to
  understand their robustness and generalizability. Our benchmark results show that
  although point cloud classification performance improves over time, the state-of-the-art
  methods are on the verge of being less robust. Based on the obtained observations,
  we propose several effective techniques to enhance point cloud classifier robustness.
  We hope our comprehensive benchmark, in-depth analysis, and proposed techniques
  could spark future research in robust 3D perception.
