title: Direct Behavior Specification via Constrained Reinforcement Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The standard formulation of Reinforcement Learning lacks a practical way
  of specifying what are admissible and forbidden behaviors. Most often, practitioners
  go about the task of behavior specification by manually engineering the reward function,
  a counter-intuitive process that requires several iterations and is prone to reward
  hacking by the agent. In this work, we argue that constrained RL, which has almost
  exclusively been used for safe RL, also has the potential to significantly reduce
  the amount of work spent for reward specification in applied RL projects. To this
  end, we propose to specify behavioral preferences in the CMDP framework and to use
  Lagrangian methods to automatically weigh each of these behavioral constraints.
  Specifically, we investigate how CMDPs can be adapted to solve goal-based tasks
  while adhering to several constraints simultaneously. We evaluate this framework
  on a set of continuous control tasks relevant to the application of Reinforcement
  Learning for NPC design in video games.
