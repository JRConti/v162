title: Optimal Algorithms for Mean Estimation under Local Differential Privacy
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We study the problem of mean estimation of $\ell_2$-bounded vectors under
  the constraint of local differential privacy. While the literature has a variety
  of algorithms that achieve the (asymptotic) optimal rates for this problem, the
  performance of these algorithms in practice can vary significantly due to varying
  (and often large) hidden constants. In this work, we investigate the question of
  designing the randomizer with the smallest variance. We show that PrivUnit (Bhowmick
  et al. 2018) with optimized parameters achieves the optimal variance among a large
  family of natural randomizers. To prove this result, we establish some properties
  of local randomizers, and use symmetrization arguments that allow us to write the
  optimal randomizer as the optimizer of a certain linear program. These structural
  results, which should extend to other problems, then allow us to show that the optimal
  randomizer belongs to the PrivUnit family. We also develop a new variant of PrivUnit
  based on the Gaussian distribution which is more amenable to mathematical analysis
  and enjoys the same optimality guarantees. This allows us to establish several useful
  properties on the exact constants of the optimal error as well as to numerically
  estimate these constants.
