title: Fairness with Adaptive Weights
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Fairness is now an important issue in machine learning. There are arising
  concerns that automated decision-making systems reflect real-world biases. Although
  a wide range of fairness-related methods have been proposed in recent years, the
  under-representation problem has been less studied. Due to the uneven distribution
  of samples from different populations, machine learning models tend to be biased
  against minority groups when trained by minimizing the average empirical risk across
  all samples. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive reweighing method to address
  representation bias. The goal of our method is to achieve group-level balance among
  different demographic groups by learning adaptive weights for each sample. Our approach
  emphasizes more on error-prone samples in prediction and enhances adequate representation
  of minority groups for fairness. We derive a closed-form solution for adaptive weight
  assignment and propose an efficient algorithm with theoretical convergence guarantees.
  We theoretically analyze the fairness of our model and empirically verify that our
  method strikes a balance between fairness and accuracy. In experiments, our method
  achieves comparable or better performance than state-of-the-art methods in both
  classification and regression tasks. Furthermore, our method exhibits robustness
  to label noise on various benchmark datasets.
