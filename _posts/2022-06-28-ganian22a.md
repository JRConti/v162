title: The Complexity of k-Means Clustering when Little is Known
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'In the area of data analysis and arguably even in machine learning as a
  whole, few approaches have been as impactful as the classical k-means clustering.
  Here, we study the complexity of k-means clustering in settings where most of the
  data is not known or simply irrelevant. To obtain a more fine-grained understanding
  of the tractability of this clustering problem, we apply the parameterized complexity
  paradigm and obtain three new algorithms for k-means clustering of incomplete data:
  one for the clustering of bounded-domain (i.e., integer) data, and two incomparable
  algorithms that target real-valued data. Our approach is based on exploiting structural
  properties of a graphical encoding of the missing entries, and we show that tractability
  can be achieved using significantly less restrictive parameterizations than in the
  complementary case of few missing entries.'
