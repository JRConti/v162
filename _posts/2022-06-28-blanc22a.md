title: A query-optimal algorithm for finding counterfactuals
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'We design an algorithm for finding counterfactuals with strong theoretical
  guarantees on its performance. For any monotone model $f : X^d \to \{0,1\}$ and
  instance $x^\star$, our algorithm makes \[{S}(f)^{O(\Delta_f(x^\star))}\cdot \log
  d\]{queries} to $f$ and returns an {\sl optimal} counterfactual for $x^\star$: a
  nearest instance $x’$ to $x^\star$ for which $f(x’)\ne f(x^\star)$. Here $S(f)$
  is the sensitivity of $f$, a discrete analogue of the Lipschitz constant, and $\Delta_f(x^\star)$
  is the distance from $x^\star$ to its nearest counterfactuals. The previous best
  known query complexity was $d^{\,O(\Delta_f(x^\star))}$, achievable by brute-force
  local search. We further prove a lower bound of $S(f)^{\Omega(\Delta_f(x^\star))}
  + \Omega(\log d)$ on the query complexity of any algorithm, thereby showing that
  the guarantees of our algorithm are essentially optimal.'
