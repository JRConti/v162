title: Deep Squared Euclidean Approximation to the Levenshtein Distance for DNA Storage
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Storing information in DNA molecules is of great interest because of its
  advantages in longevity, high storage density, and low maintenance cost. A key step
  in the DNA storage pipeline is to efficiently cluster the retrieved DNA sequences
  according to their similarities. Levenshtein distance is the most suitable metric
  on the similarity between two DNA sequences, but it is inferior in terms of computational
  complexity and less compatible with mature clustering algorithms. In this work,
  we propose a novel deep squared Euclidean embedding for DNA sequences using Siamese
  neural network, squared Euclidean embedding, and chi-squared regression. The Levenshtein
  distance is approximated by the squared Euclidean distance between the embedding
  vectors, which is fast calculated and clustering algorithm friendly. The proposed
  approach is analyzed theoretically and experimentally. The results show that the
  proposed embedding is efficient and robust.
