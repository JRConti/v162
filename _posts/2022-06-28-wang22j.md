title: Improving Screening Processes via Calibrated Subset Selection
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Many selection processes such as finding patients qualifying for a medical
  trial or retrieval pipelines in search engines consist of multiple stages, where
  an initial screening stage focuses the resources on shortlisting the most promising
  candidates. In this paper, we investigate what guarantees a screening classifier
  can provide, independently of whether it is constructed manually or trained. We
  find that current solutions do not enjoy distribution-free theoretical guarantees
  and we show that, in general, even for a perfectly calibrated classifier, there
  always exist specific pools of candidates for which its shortlist is suboptimal.
  Then, we develop a distribution-free screening algorithm—called Calibrated Subsect
  Selection (CSS)—that, given any classifier and some amount of calibration data,
  finds near-optimal shortlists of candidates that contain a desired number of qualified
  candidates in expectation. Moreover, we show that a variant of CSS that calibrates
  a given classifier multiple times across specific groups can create shortlists with
  provable diversity guarantees. Experiments on US Census survey data validate our
  theoretical results and show that the shortlists provided by our algorithm are superior
  to those provided by several competitive baselines.
