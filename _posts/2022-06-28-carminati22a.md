title: 'A Marriage between Adversarial Team Games and 2-player Games: Enabling Abstractions,
  No-regret Learning, and Subgame Solving'

abstract: "<em>Ex ante</em> correlation is becoming the mainstream approach for <em>sequential
  adversarial team games</em>, where a team of players faces another team in a zero-sum
  game. It is known that team members’ asymmetric information makes both equilibrium
  computation \\textsf{APX}-hard and team’s strategies not directly representable
  on the game tree. This latter issue prevents the adoption of successful tools for
  huge 2-player zero-sum games such as, <em>e.g.</em>, abstractions, no-regret learning,
  and subgame solving. This work shows that we can recover from this weakness by bridging
  the gap between sequential adversarial team games and 2-player games. In particular,
  we propose a new, suitable game representation that we call <em>team-public-information</em>,
  in which a team is represented as a single coordinator who only knows information
  common to the whole team and prescribes to each member an action for any possible
  private state. The resulting representation is highly <em>explainable</em>, being
  a 2-player tree in which the team’s strategies are behavioral with a direct interpretation
  and more expressive than the original extensive form when designing abstractions.
  Furthermore, we prove payoff equivalence of our representation, and we provide techniques
  that, starting directly from the extensive form, generate dramatically more compact
  representations without information loss. Finally, we experimentally evaluate our
  techniques when applied to a standard testbed, comparing their performance with
  the current state of the art."
