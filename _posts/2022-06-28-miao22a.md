title: Interpretable and Generalizable Graph Learning via Stochastic Attention Mechanism
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Interpretable graph learning is in need as many scientific applications
  depend on learning models to collect insights from graph-structured data. Previous
  works mostly focused on using post-hoc approaches to interpret pre-trained models
  (graph neural networks in particular). They argue against inherently interpretable
  models because the good interpretability of these models is often at the cost of
  their prediction accuracy. However, those post-hoc methods often fail to provide
  stable interpretation and may extract features that are spuriously correlated with
  the task. In this work, we address these issues by proposing Graph Stochastic Attention
  (GSAT). Derived from the information bottleneck principle, GSAT injects stochasticity
  to the attention weights to block the information from task-irrelevant graph components
  while learning stochasticity-reduced attention to select task-relevant subgraphs
  for interpretation. The selected subgraphs provably do not contain patterns that
  are spuriously correlated with the task under some assumptions. Extensive experiments
  on eight datasets show that GSAT outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by up
  to 20% in interpretation AUC and 5% in prediction accuracy. Our code is available
  at https://github.com/Graph-COM/GSAT.
