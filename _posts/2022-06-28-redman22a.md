title: 'Universality of Winning Tickets: A Renormalization Group Perspective'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Foundational work on the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis has suggested an exciting
  corollary: winning tickets found in the context of one task can be transferred to
  similar tasks, possibly even across different architectures. This has generated
  broad interest, but methods to study this universality are lacking. We make use
  of renormalization group theory, a powerful tool from theoretical physics, to address
  this need. We find that iterative magnitude pruning, the principal algorithm used
  for discovering winning tickets, is a renormalization group scheme, and can be viewed
  as inducing a flow in parameter space. We demonstrate that ResNet-50 models with
  transferable winning tickets have flows with common properties, as would be expected
  from the theory. Similar observations are made for BERT models, with evidence that
  their flows are near fixed points. Additionally, we leverage our framework to study
  winning tickets transferred across ResNet architectures, observing that smaller
  models have flows with more uniform properties than larger models, complicating
  transfer between them.'
