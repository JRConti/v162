title: 'PMIC: Improving Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Progressive Mutual
  Information Collaboration'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Learning to collaborate is critical in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
  (MARL). Previous works promote collaboration by maximizing the correlation of agentsâ€™
  behaviors, which is typically characterized by Mutual Information (MI) in different
  forms. However, we reveal sub-optimal collaborative behaviors also emerge with strong
  correlations, and simply maximizing the MI can, surprisingly, hinder the learning
  towards better collaboration. To address this issue, we propose a novel MARL framework,
  called Progressive Mutual Information Collaboration (PMIC), for more effective MI-driven
  collaboration. PMIC uses a new collaboration criterion measured by the MI between
  global states and joint actions. Based on this criterion, the key idea of PMIC is
  maximizing the MI associated with superior collaborative behaviors and minimizing
  the MI associated with inferior ones. The two MI objectives play complementary roles
  by facilitating better collaborations while avoiding falling into sub-optimal ones.
  Experiments on a wide range of MARL benchmarks show the superior performance of
  PMIC compared with other algorithms.
