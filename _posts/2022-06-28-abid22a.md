title: Meaningfully debugging model mistakes using conceptual counterfactual explanations
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Understanding and explaining the mistakes made by trained models is critical
  to many machine learning objectives, such as improving robustness, addressing concept
  drift, and mitigating biases. However, this is often an ad hoc process that involves
  manually looking at the model’s mistakes on many test samples and guessing at the
  underlying reasons for those incorrect predictions. In this paper, we propose a
  systematic approach, conceptual counterfactual explanations (CCE), that explains
  why a classifier makes a mistake on a particular test sample(s) in terms of human-understandable
  concepts (e.g. this zebra is misclassified as a dog because of faint stripes). We
  base CCE on two prior ideas: counterfactual explanations and concept activation
  vectors, and validate our approach on well-known pretrained models, showing that
  it explains the models’ mistakes meaningfully. In addition, for new models trained
  on data with spurious correlations, CCE accurately identifies the spurious correlation
  as the cause of model mistakes from a single misclassified test sample. On two challenging
  medical applications, CCE generated useful insights, confirmed by clinicians, into
  biases and mistakes the model makes in real-world settings. The code for CCE is
  publicly available and can easily be applied to explain mistakes in new models.'
