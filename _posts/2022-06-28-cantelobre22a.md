title: Measuring dissimilarity with diffeomorphism invariance
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Measures of similarity (or dissimilarity) are a key ingredient to many machine
  learning algorithms. We introduce DID, a pairwise dissimilarity measure applicable
  to a wide range of data spaces, which leverages the data’s internal structure to
  be invariant to diffeomorphisms. We prove that DID enjoys properties which make
  it relevant for theoretical study and practical use. By representing each datum
  as a function, DID is defined as the solution to an optimization problem in a Reproducing
  Kernel Hilbert Space and can be expressed in closed-form. In practice, it can be
  efficiently approximated via Nystr{ö}m sampling. Empirical experiments support the
  merits of DID.
