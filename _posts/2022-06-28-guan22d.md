title: Large-Scale Graph Neural Architecture Search
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Graph Neural Architecture Search (GNAS) has become a powerful method in
  automatically discovering suitable Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures for
  different tasks. However, existing approaches fail to handle large-scale graphs
  because current performance estimation strategies in GNAS are computationally expensive
  for large-scale graphs and suffer from consistency collapse issues. To tackle these
  problems, we propose the Graph ArchitectUre Search at Scale (GAUSS) method that
  can handle large-scale graphs by designing an efficient light-weight supernet and
  the joint architecture-graph sampling. In particular, a graph sampling-based single-path
  one-shot supernet is proposed to reduce the computation burden. To address the consistency
  collapse issues, we further explicitly consider the joint architecture-graph sampling
  through a novel architecture peer learning mechanism on the sampled sub-graphs and
  an architecture importance sampling algorithm. Our proposed framework is able to
  smooth the highly non-convex optimization objective and stabilize the architecture
  sampling process. We provide theoretical analyses on GAUSS and empirically evaluate
  it on five datasets whose vertex sizes range from 10^4 to 10^8. The experimental
  results demonstrate substantial improvements of GAUSS over other GNAS baselines
  on all datasets. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed GAUSS method is the
  first graph neural architecture search framework that can handle graphs with billions
  of edges within 1 GPU day.
