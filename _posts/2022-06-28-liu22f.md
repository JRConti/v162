title: Deep Probability Estimation
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Reliable probability estimation is of crucial importance in many real-world
  applications where there is inherent (aleatoric) uncertainty. Probability-estimation
  models are trained on observed outcomes (e.g. whether it has rained or not, or whether
  a patient has died or not), because the ground-truth probabilities of the events
  of interest are typically unknown. The problem is therefore analogous to binary
  classification, with the difference that the objective is to estimate probabilities
  rather than predicting the specific outcome. This work investigates probability
  estimation from high-dimensional data using deep neural networks. There exist several
  methods to improve the probabilities generated by these models but they mostly focus
  on model (epistemic) uncertainty. For problems with inherent uncertainty, it is
  challenging to evaluate performance without access to ground-truth probabilities.
  To address this, we build a synthetic dataset to study and compare different computable
  metrics. We evaluate existing methods on the synthetic data as well as on three
  real-world probability estimation tasks, all of which involve inherent uncertainty:
  precipitation forecasting from radar images, predicting cancer patient survival
  from histopathology images, and predicting car crashes from dashcam videos. We also
  give a theoretical analysis of a model for high-dimensional probability estimation
  which reproduces several of the phenomena evinced in our experiments. Finally, we
  propose a new method for probability estimation using neural networks, which modifies
  the training process to promote output probabilities that are consistent with empirical
  probabilities computed from the data. The method outperforms existing approaches
  on most metrics on the simulated as well as real-world data.'
