title: 'When AUC meets DRO: Optimizing Partial AUC for Deep Learning with Non-Convex
  Convergence Guarantee'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In this paper, we propose systematic and efficient gradient-based methods
  for both one-way and two-way partial AUC (pAUC) maximization that are applicable
  to deep learning. We propose new formulations of pAUC surrogate objectives by using
  the distributionally robust optimization (DRO) to define the loss for each individual
  positive data. We consider two formulations of DRO, one of which is based on conditional-value-at-risk
  (CVaR) that yields a non-smooth but exact estimator for pAUC, and another one is
  based on a KL divergence regularized DRO that yields an inexact but smooth (soft)
  estimator for pAUC. For both one-way and two-way pAUC maximization, we propose two
  algorithms and prove their convergence for optimizing their two formulations, respectively.
  Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms for pAUC maximization
  for deep learning on various datasets.
