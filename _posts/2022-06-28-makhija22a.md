title: Architecture Agnostic Federated Learning for Neural Networks
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: With growing concerns regarding data privacy and rapid increase in data
  volume, Federated Learning (FL) has become an important learning paradigm. However,
  jointly learning a deep neural network model in a FL setting proves to be a non-trivial
  task because of the complexities associated with the neural networks, such as varied
  architectures across clients, permutation invariance of the neurons, and presence
  of non-linear transformations in each layer. This work introduces a novel framework,
  Federated Heterogeneous Neural Networks (FedHeNN), that allows each client to build
  a personalised model without enforcing a common architecture across clients. This
  allows each client to optimize with respect to local data and compute constraints,
  while still benefiting from the learnings of other (potentially more powerful) clients.
  The key idea of FedHeNN is to use the instance-level representations obtained from
  peer clients to guide the simultaneous training on each client. The extensive experimental
  results demonstrate that the FedHeNN framework is capable of learning better performing
  models on clients in both the settings of homogeneous and heterogeneous architectures
  across clients.
