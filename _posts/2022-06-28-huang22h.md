title: 'SDQ: Stochastic Differentiable Quantization with Mixed Precision'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In order to deploy deep models in a computationally efficient manner, model
  quantization approaches have been frequently used. In addition, as new hardware
  that supports various-bit arithmetic operations, recent research on mixed precision
  quantization (MPQ) begins to fully leverage the capacity of representation by searching
  various bitwidths for different layers and modules in a network. However, previous
  studies mainly search the MPQ strategy in a costly scheme using reinforcement learning,
  neural architecture search, etc., or simply utilize partial prior knowledge for
  bitwidth distribution, which might be biased and sub-optimal. In this work, we present
  a novel Stochastic Differentiable Quantization (SDQ) method that can automatically
  learn the MPQ strategy in a more flexible and globally-optimized space with a smoother
  gradient approximation. Particularly, Differentiable Bitwidth Parameters (DBPs)
  are employed as the probability factors in stochastic quantization between adjacent
  bitwidth. After the optimal MPQ strategy is acquired, we further train our network
  with the entropy-aware bin regularization and knowledge distillation. We extensively
  evaluate our method on different networks, hardwares (GPUs and FPGA), and datasets.
  SDQ outperforms all other state-of-the-art mixed or single precision quantization
  with less bitwidth, and are even better than the original full-precision counterparts
  across various ResNet and MobileNet families, demonstrating the effectiveness and
  superiority of our method. Code will be publicly available.
