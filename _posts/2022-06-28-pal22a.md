title: A Study on the Ramanujan Graph Property of Winning Lottery Tickets
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Winning lottery tickets refer to sparse subgraphs of deep neural networks
  which have classification accuracy close to the original dense networks. Resilient
  connectivity properties of such sparse networks play an important role in their
  performance. The attempt is to identify a sparse and yet well-connected network
  to guarantee unhindered information flow. Connectivity in a graph is best characterized
  by its spectral expansion property. Ramanujan graphs are robust expanders which
  lead to sparse but highly-connected networks, and thus aid in studying the winning
  tickets. A feedforward neural network consists of a sequence of bipartite graphs
  representing its layers. We analyze the Ramanujan graph property of such bipartite
  layers in terms of their spectral characteristics using the Cheegerâ€™s inequality
  for irregular graphs. It is empirically observed that the winning ticket networks
  preserve the Ramanujan graph property and achieve a high accuracy even when the
  layers are sparse. Accuracy and robustness to noise start declining as many of the
  layers lose the property. Next we find a robust winning lottery ticket by pruning
  individual layers while retaining their respective Ramanujan graph property. This
  strategy is observed to improve the performance of existing network pruning algorithms.
