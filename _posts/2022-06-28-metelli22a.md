title: Stochastic Rising Bandits
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: This paper is in the field of stochastic Multi-Armed Bandits (MABs), i.e.,
  those sequential selection techniques able to learn online using only the feedback
  given by the chosen option (a.k.a. arm). We study a particular case of the rested
  and restless bandits in which the arms’ expected payoff is monotonically non-decreasing.
  This characteristic allows designing specifically crafted algorithms that exploit
  the regularity of the payoffs to provide tight regret bounds. We design an algorithm
  for the rested case (R-ed-UCB) and one for the restless case (R-less-UCB), providing
  a regret bound depending on the properties of the instance and, under certain circumstances,
  of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$. We empirically compare our algorithms
  with state-of-the-art methods for non-stationary MABs over several synthetically
  generated tasks and an online model selection problem for a real-world dataset.
  Finally, using synthetic and real-world data, we illustrate the effectiveness of
  the proposed approaches compared with state-of-the-art algorithms for the non-stationary
  bandits.
