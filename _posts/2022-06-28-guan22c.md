title: Leveraging Approximate Symbolic Models for Reinforcement Learning via Skill
  Diversity
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Creating reinforcement learning (RL) agents that are capable of accepting
  and leveraging task-specific knowledge from humans has been long identified as a
  possible strategy for developing scalable approaches for solving long-horizon problems.
  While previous works have looked at the possibility of using symbolic models along
  with RL approaches, they tend to assume that the high-level action models are executable
  at low level and the fluents can exclusively characterize all desirable MDP states.
  Symbolic models of real world tasks are however often incomplete. To this end, we
  introduce Approximate Symbolic-Model Guided Reinforcement Learning, wherein we will
  formalize the relationship between the symbolic model and the underlying MDP that
  will allow us to characterize the incompleteness of the symbolic model. We will
  use these models to extract high-level landmarks that will be used to decompose
  the task. At the low level, we learn a set of diverse policies for each possible
  task subgoal identified by the landmark, which are then stitched together. We evaluate
  our system by testing on three different benchmark domains and show how even with
  incomplete symbolic model information, our approach is able to discover the task
  structure and efficiently guide the RL agent towards the goal.
