title: Last Iterate Risk Bounds of SGD with Decaying Stepsize for Overparameterized
  Linear Regression
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) has been shown to generalize well in many
  deep learning applications. In practice, one often runs SGD with a geometrically
  decaying stepsize, i.e., a constant initial stepsize followed by multiple geometric
  stepsize decay, and uses the last iterate as the output. This kind of SGD is known
  to be nearly minimax optimal for classical finite-dimensional linear regression
  problems (Ge et al., 2019). However, a sharp analysis for the last iterate of SGD
  in the overparameterized setting is still open. In this paper, we provide a problem-dependent
  analysis on the last iterate risk bounds of SGD with decaying stepsize, for (overparameterized)
  linear regression problems. In particular, for last iterate SGD with (tail) geometrically
  decaying stepsize, we prove nearly matching upper and lower bounds on the excess
  risk. Moreover, we provide an excess risk lower bound for last iterate SGD with
  polynomially decaying stepsize and demonstrate the advantage of geometrically decaying
  stepsize in an instance-wise manner, which complements the minimax rate comparison
  made in prior work.
