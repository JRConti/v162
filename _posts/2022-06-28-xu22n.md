title: 'Adversarially Robust Models may not Transfer Better: Sufficient Conditions
  for Domain Transferability from the View of Regularization'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Machine learning (ML) robustness and domain generalization are fundamentally
  correlated: they essentially concern data distribution shifts under adversarial
  and natural settings, respectively. On one hand, recent studies show that more robust
  (adversarially trained) models are more generalizable. On the other hand, there
  is a lack of theoretical understanding of their fundamental connections. In this
  paper, we explore the relationship between regularization and domain transferability
  considering different factors such as norm regularization and data augmentations
  (DA). We propose a general theoretical framework proving that factors involving
  the model function class regularization are sufficient conditions for relative domain
  transferability. Our analysis implies that â€œrobustness" is neither necessary nor
  sufficient for transferability; rather, regularization is a more fundamental perspective
  for understanding domain transferability. We then discuss popular DA protocols (including
  adversarial training) and show when they can be viewed as the function class regularization
  under certain conditions and therefore improve generalization. We conduct extensive
  experiments to verify our theoretical findings and show several counterexamples
  where robustness and generalization are negatively correlated on different datasets.'
