title: Deciphering Lasso-based Classification Through a Large Dimensional Analysis
  of the Iterative Soft-Thresholding Algorithm
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: This paper proposes a theoretical analysis of a Lasso-based classification
  algorithm. Leveraging on a realistic regime where the dimension of the data $p$
  and their number $n$ are of the same order of magnitude, the theoretical classification
  error is derived as a function of the data statistics. As a result, insights into
  the functioning of the Lasso in classification and its differences with competing
  algorithms are highlighted. Our work is based on an original novel analysis of the
  Iterative Soft-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA), which may be of independent interest
  beyond the particular problem studied here and may be adapted to similar iterative
  schemes. A theoretical optimization of the modelâ€™s hyperparameters is also provided,
  which allows for the data- and time-consuming cross-validation to be avoided. Finally,
  several applications on synthetic and real data are provided to validate the theoretical
  study and justify its impact in the design and understanding of algorithms of practical
  interest.
