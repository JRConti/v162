title: Convergence and Recovery Guarantees of the K-Subspaces Method for Subspace
  Clustering
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The K-subspaces (KSS) method is a generalization of the K-means method for
  subspace clustering. In this work, we present local convergence analysis and a recovery
  guarantee for KSS, assuming data are generated by the semi-random union of subspaces
  model, where $N$ points are randomly sampled from $K \ge 2$ overlapping subspaces.
  We show that if the initial assignment of the KSS method lies within a neighborhood
  of a true clustering, it converges at a superlinear rate and finds the correct clustering
  within $\Theta(\log\log N)$ iterations with high probability. Moreover, we propose
  a thresholding inner-product based spectral method for initialization and prove
  that it produces a point in this neighborhood. We also present numerical results
  of the studied method to support our theoretical developments.
