title: Neural Tangent Kernel Analysis of Deep Narrow Neural Networks
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The tremendous recent progress in analyzing the training dynamics of overparameterized
  neural networks has primarily focused on wide networks and therefore does not sufficiently
  address the role of depth in deep learning. In this work, we present the first trainability
  guarantee of infinitely deep but narrow neural networks. We study the infinite-depth
  limit of a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with a specific initialization and establish
  a trainability guarantee using the NTK theory. We then extend the analysis to an
  infinitely deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and perform brief experiments.
