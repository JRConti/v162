title: Robust alignment of cross-session recordings of neural population activity
  by behaviour via unsupervised domain adaptation
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Neural population activity relating to behaviour is assumed to be inherently
  low-dimensional despite the observed high dimensionality of data recorded using
  multi-electrode arrays. Therefore, predicting behaviour from neural population recordings
  has been shown to be most effective when using latent variable models. Over time
  however, the activity of single neurons can drift, and different neurons will be
  recorded due to movement of implanted neural probes. This means that a decoder trained
  to predict behaviour on one day performs worse when tested on a different day. On
  the other hand, evidence suggests that the latent dynamics underlying behaviour
  may be stable even over months and years. Based on this idea, we introduce a model
  capable of inferring behaviourally relevant latent dynamics from previously unseen
  data recorded from the same animal, without any need for decoder recalibration.
  We show that unsupervised domain adaptation combined with a sequential variational
  autoencoder, trained on several sessions, can achieve good generalisation to unseen
  data and correctly predict behaviour where conventional methods fail. Our results
  further support the hypothesis that behaviour-related neural dynamics are low-dimensional
  and stable over time, and will enable more effective and flexible use of brain computer
  interface technologies.
