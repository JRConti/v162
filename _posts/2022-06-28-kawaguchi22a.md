title: Robustness Implies Generalization via Data-Dependent Generalization Bounds
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: This paper proves that robustness implies generalization via data-dependent
  generalization bounds. As a result, robustness and generalization are shown to be
  connected closely in a data-dependent manner. Our bounds improve previous bounds
  in two directions, to solve an open problem that has seen little development since
  2010. The first is to reduce the dependence on the covering number. The second is
  to remove the dependence on the hypothesis space. We present several examples, including
  ones for lasso and deep learning, in which our bounds are provably preferable. The
  experiments on real-world data and theoretical models demonstrate near-exponential
  improvements in various situations. To achieve these improvements, we do not require
  additional assumptions on the unknown distribution; instead, we only incorporate
  an observable and computable property of the training samples. A key technical innovation
  is an improved concentration bound for multinomial random variables that is of independent
  interest beyond robustness and generalization.
