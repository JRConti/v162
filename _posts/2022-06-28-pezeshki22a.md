title: 'Multi-scale Feature Learning Dynamics: Insights for Double Descent'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'An intriguing phenomenon that arises from the high-dimensional learning
  dynamics of neural networks is the phenomenon of “double descent”. The more commonly
  studied aspect of this phenomenon corresponds to <em>model-wise</em> double descent
  where the test error exhibits a second descent with increasing model complexity,
  beyond the classical U-shaped error curve. In this work, we investigate the origins
  of the less studied <em>epoch-wise</em> double descent in which the test error undergoes
  two non-monotonous transitions, or descents as the training time increases. We study
  a linear teacher-student setup exhibiting epoch-wise double descent similar to that
  in deep neural networks. In this setting, we derive closed-form analytical expressions
  describing the generalization error in terms of low-dimensional scalar macroscopic
  variables. We find that double descent can be attributed to distinct features being
  learned at different scales: as fast-learning features overfit, slower-learning
  features start to fit, resulting in a second descent in test error. We validate
  our findings through numerical simulations where our theory accurately predicts
  empirical findings and remains consistent with observations in deep neural networks.'
