title: Fast Aquatic Swimmer Optimization with Differentiable Projective Dynamics and
  Neural Network Hydrodynamic Models
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Aquatic locomotion is a classic fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problem
  of interest to biologists and engineers. Solving the fully coupled FSI equations
  for incompressible Navier-Stokes and finite elasticity is computationally expensive.
  Optimizing robotic swimmer design within such a system generally involves cumbersome,
  gradient-free procedures on top of the already costly simulation. To address this
  challenge we present a novel, fully differentiable hybrid approach to FSI that combines
  a 2D direct numerical simulation for the deformable solid structure of the swimmer
  and a physics-constrained neural network surrogate to capture hydrodynamic effects
  of the fluid. For the deformable solid simulation of the swimmerâ€™s body, we use
  state-of-the-art techniques from the field of computer graphics to speed up the
  finite-element method (FEM). For the fluid simulation, we use a U-Net architecture
  trained with a physics-based loss function to predict the flow field at each time
  step. The pressure and velocity field outputs from the neural network are sampled
  around the boundary of our swimmer using an immersed boundary method (IBM) to compute
  its swimming motion accurately and efficiently. We demonstrate the computational
  efficiency and differentiability of our hybrid simulator on a 2D carangiform swimmer.
  Due to differentiability, the simulator can be used for computational design of
  controls for soft bodies immersed in fluids via direct gradient-based optimization.
