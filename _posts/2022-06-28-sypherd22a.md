title: Being Properly Improper
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Properness for supervised losses stipulates that the loss function shapes
  the learning algorithm towards the true posterior of the data generating distribution.
  Unfortunately, data in modern machine learning can be corrupted or twisted in many
  ways. Hence, optimizing a proper loss function on twisted data could perilously
  lead the learning algorithm towards the twisted posterior, rather than to the desired
  clean posterior. Many papers cope with specific twists (e.g., label/feature/adversarial
  noise), but there is a growing need for a unified and actionable understanding atop
  properness. Our chief theoretical contribution is a generalization of the properness
  framework with a notion called twist-properness, which delineates loss functions
  with the ability to "untwist" the twisted posterior into the clean posterior. Notably,
  we show that a nontrivial extension of a loss function called alpha-loss, which
  was first introduced in information theory, is twist-proper. We study the twist-proper
  alpha-loss under a novel boosting algorithm, called PILBoost, and provide formal
  and experimental results for this algorithm. Our overarching practical conclusion
  is that the twist-proper alpha-loss outperforms the proper log-loss on several variants
  of twisted data.
