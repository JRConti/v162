title: 'IGLUE: A Benchmark for Transfer Learning across Modalities, Tasks, and Languages'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Reliable evaluation benchmarks designed for replicability and comprehensiveness
  have driven progress in machine learning. Due to the lack of a multilingual benchmark,
  however, vision-and-language research has mostly focused on English language tasks.
  To fill this gap, we introduce the Image-Grounded Language Understanding Evaluation
  benchmark. IGLUE brings together{—}by both aggregating pre-existing datasets and
  creating new ones{—}visual question answering, cross-modal retrieval, grounded reasoning,
  and grounded entailment tasks across 20 diverse languages. Our benchmark enables
  the evaluation of multilingual multimodal models for transfer learning, not only
  in a zero-shot setting, but also in newly defined few-shot learning setups. Based
  on the evaluation of the available state-of-the-art models, we find that translate-test
  transfer is superior to zero-shot transfer and that few-shot learning is hard to
  harness for many tasks. Moreover, downstream performance is partially explained
  by the amount of available unlabelled textual data for pretraining, and only weakly
  by the typological distance of target{–}source languages. We hope to encourage future
  research efforts in this area by releasing the benchmark to the community.
