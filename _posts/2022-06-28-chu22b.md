title: 'TPC: Transformation-Specific Smoothing for Point Cloud Models'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Point cloud models with neural network architectures have achieved great
  success and been widely used in safety-critical applications, such as Lidar-based
  recognition systems in autonomous vehicles. However, such models are shown vulnerable
  against adversarial attacks which aim to apply stealthy semantic transformations
  such as rotation and tapering to mislead model predictions. In this paper, we propose
  a transformation-specific smoothing framework TPC, which provides tight and scalable
  robustness guarantees for point cloud models against semantic transformation attacks.
  We first categorize common 3D transformations into two categories: composable (e.g.,
  rotation) and indirectly composable (e.g., tapering), and we present generic robustness
  certification strategies for both categories. We then specify unique certification
  protocols for a range of specific semantic transformations and derive strong robustness
  guarantees. Extensive experiments on several common 3D transformations show that
  TPC significantly outperforms the state of the art. For example, our framework boosts
  the certified accuracy against twisting transformation along z-axis (within $\pm$20{\textdegree})
  from 20.3% to 83.8%. Codes and models are available at https://github.com/Qianhewu/Point-Cloud-Smoothing.'
