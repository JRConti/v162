title: 'Simplex Neural Population Learning: Any-Mixture Bayes-Optimality in Symmetric
  Zero-sum Games'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Learning to play optimally against any mixture over a diverse set of strategies
  is of important practical interests in competitive games. In this paper, we propose
  simplex-NeuPL that satisfies two desiderata simultaneously: i) learning a population
  of strategically diverse basis policies, represented by a single conditional network;
  ii) using the same network, learn best-responses to any mixture over the simplex
  of basis policies. We show that the resulting conditional policies incorporate prior
  information about their opponents effectively, enabling near optimal returns against
  arbitrary mixture policies in a game with tractable best-responses. We verify that
  such policies behave Bayes-optimally under uncertainty and offer insights in using
  this flexibility at test time. Finally, we offer evidence that learning best-responses
  to any mixture policies is an effective auxiliary task for strategic exploration,
  which, by itself, can lead to more performant populations.'
