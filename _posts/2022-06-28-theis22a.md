title: Algorithms for the Communication of Samples
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The efficient communication of noisy data has applications in several areas
  of machine learning, such as neural compression or differential privacy, and is
  also known as reverse channel coding or the channel simulation problem. Here we
  propose two new coding schemes with practical advantages over existing approaches.
  First, we introduce ordered random coding (ORC) which uses a simple trick to reduce
  the coding cost of previous approaches. This scheme further illuminates a connection
  between schemes based on importance sampling and the so-called Poisson functional
  representation. Second, we describe a hybrid coding scheme which uses dithered quantization
  to more efficiently communicate samples from distributions with bounded support.
