title: On the Equivalence Between Temporal and Static Equivariant Graph Representations
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'This work formalizes the associational task of predicting node attribute
  evolution in temporal graphs from the perspective of learning equivariant representations.
  We show that node representations in temporal graphs can be cast into two distinct
  frameworks: (a) The most popular approach, which we denote as time-and-graph, where
  equivariant graph (e.g., GNN) and sequence (e.g., RNN) representations are intertwined
  to represent the temporal evolution of node attributes in the graph; and (b) an
  approach that we denote as time-then-graph, where the sequences describing the node
  and edge dynamics are represented first, then fed as node and edge attributes into
  a static equivariant graph representation that comes after. Interestingly, we show
  that time-then-graph representations have an expressivity advantage over time-and-graph
  representations when both use component GNNs that are not most-expressive (e.g.,
  1-Weisfeiler-Lehman GNNs). Moreover, while our goal is not necessarily to obtain
  state-of-the-art results, our experiments show that time-then-graph methods are
  capable of achieving better performance and efficiency than state-of-the-art time-and-graph
  methods in some real-world tasks, thereby showcasing that the time-then-graph framework
  is a worthy addition to the graph ML toolbox.'
