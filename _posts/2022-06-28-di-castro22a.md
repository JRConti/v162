title: Analysis of Stochastic Processes through Replay Buffers
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Replay buffers are a key component in many reinforcement learning schemes.
  Yet, their theoretical properties are not fully understood. In this paper we analyze
  a system where a stochastic process X is pushed into a replay buffer and then randomly
  sampled to generate a stochastic process Y from the replay buffer. We provide an
  analysis of the properties of the sampled process such as stationarity, Markovity
  and autocorrelation in terms of the properties of the original process. Our theoretical
  analysis sheds light on why replay buffer may be a good de-correlator. Our analysis
  provides theoretical tools for proving the convergence of replay buffer based algorithms
  which are prevalent in reinforcement learning schemes.
