title: Counterfactual Prediction for Outcome-Oriented Treatments
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Large amounts of efforts have been devoted into learning counterfactual
  treatment outcome under various settings, including binary/continuous/multiple treatments.
  Most of these literature aims to minimize the estimation error of counterfactual
  outcome for the whole treatment space. However, in most scenarios when the counterfactual
  prediction model is utilized to assist decision-making, people are only concerned
  with the small fraction of treatments that can potentially induce superior outcome
  (i.e. outcome-oriented treatments). This gap of objective is even more severe when
  the number of possible treatments is large, for example under the continuous treatment
  setting. To overcome it, we establish a new objective of optimizing counterfactual
  prediction on outcome-oriented treatments, propose a novel Outcome-Oriented Sample
  Re-weighting (OOSR) method to make the predictive model concentrate more on outcome-oriented
  treatments, and theoretically analyze that our method can improve treatment selection
  towards the optimal one. Extensive experimental results on both synthetic datasets
  and semi-synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
