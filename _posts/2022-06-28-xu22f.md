title: Inferring Cause and Effect in the Presence of Heteroscedastic Noise
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We study the problem of identifying cause and effect over two univariate
  continuous variables $X$ and $Y$ from a sample of their joint distribution. Our
  focus lies on the setting when the variance of the noise may be dependent on the
  cause. We propose to partition the domain of the cause into multiple segments where
  the noise indeed is dependent. To this end, we minimize a scale-invariant, penalized
  regression score, finding the optimal partitioning using dynamic programming. We
  show under which conditions this allows us to identify the causal direction for
  the linear setting with heteroscedastic noise, for the non-linear setting with homoscedastic
  noise, as well as empirically confirm that these results generalize to the non-linear
  and heteroscedastic case. Altogether, the ability to model heteroscedasticity translates
  into an improved performance in telling cause from effect on a wide range of synthetic
  and real-world datasets.
