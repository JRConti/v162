title: 'HyperImpute: Generalized Iterative Imputation with Automatic Model Selection'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Consider the problem of imputing missing values in a dataset. One the one
  hand, conventional approaches using iterative imputation benefit from the simplicity
  and customizability of learning conditional distributions directly, but suffer from
  the practical requirement for appropriate model specification of each and every
  variable. On the other hand, recent methods using deep generative modeling benefit
  from the capacity and efficiency of learning with neural network function approximators,
  but are often difficult to optimize and rely on stronger data assumptions. In this
  work, we study an approach that marries the advantages of both: We propose *HyperImpute*,
  a generalized iterative imputation framework for adaptively and automatically configuring
  column-wise models and their hyperparameters. Practically, we provide a concrete
  implementation with out-of-the-box learners, optimizers, simulators, and extensible
  interfaces. Empirically, we investigate this framework via comprehensive experiments
  and sensitivities on a variety of public datasets, and demonstrate its ability to
  generate accurate imputations relative to a strong suite of benchmarks. Contrary
  to recent work, we believe our findings constitute a strong defense of the iterative
  imputation paradigm.'
