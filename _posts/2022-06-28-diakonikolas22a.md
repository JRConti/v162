title: Streaming Algorithms for High-Dimensional Robust Statistics
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We study high-dimensional robust statistics tasks in the streaming model.
  A recent line of work obtained computationally efficient algorithms for a range
  of high-dimensional robust statistics tasks. Unfortunately, all previous algorithms
  require storing the entire dataset, incurring memory at least quadratic in the dimension.
  In this work, we develop the first efficient streaming algorithms for high-dimensional
  robust statistics with near-optimal memory requirements (up to logarithmic factors).
  Our main result is for the task of high-dimensional robust mean estimation in (a
  strengthening of) Huberâ€™s contamination model. We give an efficient single-pass
  streaming algorithm for this task with near-optimal error guarantees and space complexity
  nearly-linear in the dimension. As a corollary, we obtain streaming algorithms with
  near-optimal space complexity for several more complex tasks, including robust covariance
  estimation, robust regression, and more generally robust stochastic optimization.
