title: Kernel Methods for Radial Transformed Compositional Data with Many Zeros
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Compositional data analysis with a high proportion of zeros has gained increasing
  popularity, especially in chemometrics and human gut microbiomes research. Statistical
  analyses of this type of data are typically carried out via a log-ratio transformation
  after replacing zeros with small positive values. We should note, however, that
  this procedure is geometrically improper, as it causes anomalous distortions through
  the transformation. We propose a radial transformation that does not require zero
  substitutions and more importantly results in essential equivalence between domains
  before and after the transformation. We show that a rich class of kernels on hyperspheres
  can successfully define a kernel embedding for compositional data based on this
  equivalence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that theoretically
  establishes the availability of the extensive library of kernel-based machine learning
  methods for compositional data. The applicability of the proposed approach is demonstrated
  with kernel principal component analysis.
