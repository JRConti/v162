title: Combining Diverse Feature Priors
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: To improve model generalization, model designers often restrict the features
  that their models use, either implicitly or explicitly. In this work, we explore
  the design space of leveraging such feature priors by viewing them as distinct perspectives
  on the data. Specifically, we find that models trained with diverse sets of explicit
  feature priors have less overlapping failure modes, and can thus be combined more
  effectively. Moreover, we demonstrate that jointly training such models on additional
  (unlabeled) data allows them to correct each otherâ€™s mistakes, which, in turn, leads
  to better generalization and resilience to spurious correlations.
