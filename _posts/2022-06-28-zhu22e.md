title: Resilient and Communication Efficient Learning for Heterogeneous Federated
  Systems
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The rise of Federated Learning (FL) is bringing machine learning to edge
  computing by utilizing data scattered across edge devices. However, the heterogeneity
  of edge network topologies and the uncertainty of wireless transmission are two
  major obstructions of FLâ€™s wide application in edge computing, leading to prohibitive
  convergence time and high communication cost. In this work, we propose an FL scheme
  to address both challenges simultaneously. Specifically, we enable edge devices
  to learn self-distilled neural networks that are readily prunable to arbitrary sizes,
  which capture the knowledge of the learning domain in a nested and progressive manner.
  Not only does our approach tackle system heterogeneity by serving edge devices with
  varying model architectures, but it also alleviates the issue of connection uncertainty
  by allowing transmitting part of the model parameters under faulty network connections,
  without wasting the contributing knowledge of the transmitted parameters. Extensive
  empirical studies show that under system heterogeneity and network instability,
  our approach demonstrates significant resilience and higher communication efficiency
  compared to the state-of-the-art.
