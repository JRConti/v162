title: Self-Organized Polynomial-Time Coordination Graphs
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Coordination graph is a promising approach to model agent collaboration
  in multi-agent reinforcement learning. It conducts a graph-based value factorization
  and induces explicit coordination among agents to complete complicated tasks. However,
  one critical challenge in this paradigm is the complexity of greedy action selection
  with respect to the factorized values. It refers to the decentralized constraint
  optimization problem (DCOP), which and whose constant-ratio approximation are NP-hard
  problems. To bypass this systematic hardness, this paper proposes a novel method,
  named Self-Organized Polynomial-time Coordination Graphs (SOP-CG), which uses structured
  graph classes to guarantee the accuracy and the computational efficiency of collaborated
  action selection. SOP-CG employs dynamic graph topology to ensure sufficient value
  function expressiveness. The graph selection is unified into an end-to-end learning
  paradigm. In experiments, we show that our approach learns succinct and well-adapted
  graph topologies, induces effective coordination, and improves performance across
  a variety of cooperative multi-agent tasks.
