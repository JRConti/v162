title: Identification of Linear Non-Gaussian Latent Hierarchical Structure
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Traditional causal discovery methods mainly focus on estimating causal relations
  among measured variables, but in many real-world problems, such as questionnaire-based
  psychometric studies, measured variables are generated by latent variables that
  are causally related. Accordingly, this paper investigates the problem of discovering
  the hidden causal variables and estimating the causal structure, including both
  the causal relations among latent variables and those between latent and measured
  variables. We relax the frequently-used measurement assumption and allow the children
  of latent variables to be latent as well, and hence deal with a specific type of
  latent hierarchical causal structure. In particular, we define a minimal latent
  hierarchical structure and show that for linear non-Gaussian models with the minimal
  latent hierarchical structure, the whole structure is identifiable from only the
  measured variables. Moreover, we develop a principled method to identify the structure
  by testing for Generalized Independent Noise (GIN) conditions in specific ways.
  Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data show the effectiveness
  of the proposed approach.
