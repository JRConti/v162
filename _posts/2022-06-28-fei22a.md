title: Matching Structure for Dual Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Many natural language processing (NLP) tasks appear in dual forms, which
  are generally solved by dual learning technique that models the dualities between
  the coupled tasks. In this work, we propose to further enhance dual learning with
  structure matching that explicitly builds structural connections in between. Starting
  with the dual text$\leftrightarrow$text generation, we perform dually-syntactic
  structure co-echoing of the region of interest (RoI) between the task pair, together
  with a syntax cross-reconstruction at the decoding side. We next extend the idea
  to a text$\leftrightarrow$non-text setup, making alignment between the syntactic-semantic
  structure. Over 2*14 tasks covering 5 dual learning scenarios, the proposed structure
  matching method shows its significant effectiveness in enhancing existing dual learning.
  Our method can retrieve the key RoIs that are highly crucial to the task performance.
  Besides NLP tasks, it is also revealed that our approach has great potential in
  facilitating more non-text$\leftrightarrow$non-text scenarios.
