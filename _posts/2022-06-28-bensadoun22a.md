title: Neural Inverse Kinematic
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Inverse kinematic (IK) methods recover the parameters of the joints, given
  the desired position of selected elements in the kinematic chain. While the problem
  is well-defined and low-dimensional, it has to be solved rapidly, accounting for
  multiple possible solutions. In this work, we propose a neural IK method that employs
  the hierarchical structure of the problem to sequentially sample valid joint angles
  conditioned on the desired position and on the preceding joints along the chain.
  In our solution, a hypernetwork $f$ recovers the parameters of multiple primary
  networks {$g_1,g_2,â€¦,g_N$, where $N$ is the number of joints}, such that each $g_i$
  outputs a distribution of possible joint angles, and is conditioned on the sampled
  values obtained from the previous primary networks $g_j, j<i$. The hypernetwork
  can be trained on readily available pairs of matching joint angles and positions,
  without observing multiple solutions. At test time, a high-variance joint distribution
  is presented, by sampling sequentially from the primary networks. We demonstrate
  the advantage of the proposed method both in comparison to other IK methods for
  isolated instances of IK and with regard to following the path of the end effector
  in Cartesian space.
