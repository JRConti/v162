title: Improving Language Models by Retrieving from Trillions of Tokens
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We enhance auto-regressive language models by conditioning on document chunks
  retrieved from a large corpus, based on local similarity with preceding tokens.
  With a 2 trillion token database, our Retrieval-Enhanced Transformer (RETRO) obtains
  comparable performance to GPT-3 and Jurassic-1 on the Pile, despite using 25{\texttimes}
  fewer parameters. After fine-tuning, RETRO performance translates to downstream
  knowledge-intensive tasks such as question answering. RETRO combines a frozen Bert
  retriever, a differentiable encoder and a chunked cross-attention mechanism to predict
  tokens based on an order of magnitude more data than what is typically consumed
  during training. We typically train RETRO from scratch, yet can also rapidly RETROfit
  pre-trained transformers with retrieval and still achieve good performance. Our
  work opens up new avenues for improving language models through explicit memory
  at unprecedented scale.
