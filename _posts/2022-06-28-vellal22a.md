title: Bregman Power k-Means for Clustering Exponential Family Data
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Recent progress in center-based clustering algorithms combats poor local
  minima by implicit annealing through a family of generalized means. These methods
  are variations of Lloydâ€™s celebrated k-means algorithm, and are most appropriate
  for spherical clusters such as those arising from Gaussian data. In this paper,
  we bridge these new algorithmic advances to classical work on hard clustering under
  Bregman divergences, which enjoy a bijection to exponential family distributions
  and are thus well-suited for clustering objects arising from a breadth of data generating
  mechanisms. The elegant properties of Bregman divergences allow us to maintain closed
  form updates in a simple and transparent algorithm, and moreover lead to new theoretical
  arguments for establishing finite sample bounds that relax the bounded support assumption
  made in the existing state of the art. Additionally, we consider thorough empirical
  analyses on simulated experiments and a case study on rainfall data, finding that
  the proposed method outperforms existing peer methods in a variety of non-Gaussian
  data settings.
