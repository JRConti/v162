title: 'Neural Tangent Kernel Beyond the Infinite-Width Limit: Effects of Depth and
  Initialization'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) is widely used to analyze overparametrized
  neural networks due to the famous result by Jacot et al. (2018): in the infinite-width
  limit, the NTK is deterministic and constant during training. However, this result
  cannot explain the behavior of deep networks, since it generally does not hold if
  depth and width tend to infinity simultaneously. In this paper, we study the NTK
  of fully-connected ReLU networks with depth comparable to width. We prove that the
  NTK properties depend significantly on the depth-to-width ratio and the distribution
  of parameters at initialization. In fact, our results indicate the importance of
  the three phases in the hyperparameter space identified in Poole et al. (2016):
  ordered, chaotic and the edge of chaos (EOC). We derive exact expressions for the
  NTK dispersion in the infinite-depth-and-width limit in all three phases and conclude
  that the NTK variability grows exponentially with depth at the EOC and in the chaotic
  phase but not in the ordered phase. We also show that the NTK of deep networks may
  stay constant during training only in the ordered phase and discuss how the structure
  of the NTK matrix changes during training.'
