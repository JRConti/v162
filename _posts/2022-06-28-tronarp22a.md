title: 'Fenrir: Physics-Enhanced Regression for Initial Value Problems'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We show how probabilistic numerics can be used to convert an initial value
  problem into a Gauss–Markov process parametrised by the dynamics of the initial
  value problem. Consequently, the often difficult problem of parameter estimation
  in ordinary differential equations is reduced to hyper-parameter estimation in Gauss–Markov
  regression, which tends to be considerably easier. The method’s relation and benefits
  in comparison to classical numerical integration and gradient matching approaches
  is elucidated. In particular, the method can, in contrast to gradient matching,
  handle partial observations, and has certain routes for escaping local optima not
  available to classical numerical integration. Experimental results demonstrate that
  the method is on par or moderately better than competing approaches.
