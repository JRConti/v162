title: Describing Differences between Text Distributions with Natural Language
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'How do two <em>distributions</em> of text differ? Humans are slow at answering
  this, since discovering patterns might require tediously reading through hundreds
  of samples. We propose to automatically summarize the differences by “learning a
  natural language hypothesis": given two distributions $D_{0}$ and $D_{1}$, we search
  for a description that is more often true for $D_{1}$, e.g., “<em>is military-related.</em>"
  To tackle this problem, we fine-tune GPT-3 to propose descriptions with the prompt:
  “[samples of $D_{0}$] + [samples of $D_{1}$] + <em>the difference between them is
  \underline{\space\space\space\space</em>}". We then re-rank the descriptions by
  checking how often they hold on a larger set of samples with a learned verifier.
  On a benchmark of 54 real-world binary classification tasks, while GPT-3 Curie (13B)
  only generates a description similar to human annotation 7% of the time, the performance
  reaches 61% with fine-tuning and re-ranking, and our best system using GPT-3 Davinci
  (175B) reaches 76%. We apply our system to describe distribution shifts, debug dataset
  shortcuts, summarize unknown tasks, and label text clusters, and present analyses
  based on automatically generated descriptions.'
