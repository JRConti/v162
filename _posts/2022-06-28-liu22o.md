title: Adaptive Accelerated (Extra-)Gradient Methods with Variance Reduction
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'In this paper, we study the finite-sum convex optimization problem focusing
  on the general convex case. Recently, the study of variance reduced (VR) methods
  and their accelerated variants has made exciting progress. However, the step size
  used in the existing VR algorithms typically depends on the smoothness parameter,
  which is often unknown and requires tuning in practice. To address this problem,
  we propose two novel adaptive VR algorithms: <em>Adaptive Variance Reduced Accelerated
  Extra-Gradient</em> (AdaVRAE) and<em> Adaptive Variance Reduced Accelerated Gradient</em>
  (AdaVRAG). Our algorithms do not require knowledge of the smoothness parameter.
  AdaVRAE uses $\mathcal{O}\left(n\log\log n+\sqrt{\frac{n\beta}{\epsilon}}\right)$
  and AdaVRAG uses $\mathcal{O}\left(n\log\log n+\sqrt{\frac{n\beta\log\beta}{\epsilon}}\right)$
  gradient evaluations to attain an $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$-suboptimal solution, where
  $n$ is the number of functions in the finite sum and $\beta$ is the smoothness parameter.
  This result matches the best-known convergence rate of non-adaptive VR methods and
  it improves upon the convergence of the state of the art adaptive VR method, AdaSVRG.
  We demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithms compared with previous
  methods in experiments on real-world datasets.'
