title: 'Born-Infeld (BI) for AI: Energy-Conserving Descent (ECD) for Optimization'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We introduce a novel framework for optimization based on energy-conserving
  Hamiltonian dynamics in a strongly mixing (chaotic) regime and establish its key
  properties analytically and numerically. The prototype is a discretization of Born-Infeld
  dynamics, with a squared relativistic speed limit depending on the objective function.
  This class of frictionless, energy-conserving optimizers proceeds unobstructed until
  slowing naturally near the minimal loss, which dominates the phase space volume
  of the system. Building from studies of chaotic systems such as dynamical billiards,
  we formulate a specific algorithm with good performance on machine learning and
  PDE-solving tasks, including generalization. It cannot stop at a high local minimum,
  an advantage in non-convex loss functions, and proceeds faster than GD+momentum
  in shallow valleys.
