title: 'FedScale: Benchmarking Model and System Performance of Federated Learning
  at Scale'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We present FedScale, a federated learning (FL) benchmarking suite with realistic
  datasets and a scalable runtime to enable reproducible FL research. FedScale datasets
  encompass a wide range of critical FL tasks, ranging from image classification and
  object detection to language modeling and speech recognition. Each dataset comes
  with a unified evaluation protocol using real-world data splits and evaluation metrics.
  To reproduce realistic FL behavior, FedScale contains a scalable and extensible
  runtime. It provides high-level APIs to implement FL algorithms, deploy them at
  scale across diverse hardware and software backends, and evaluate them at scale,
  all with minimal developer efforts. We combine the two to perform systematic benchmarking
  experiments and highlight potential opportunities for heterogeneity-aware co-optimizations
  in FL. FedScale is open-source and actively maintained by contributors from different
  institutions at http://fedscale.ai. We welcome feedback and contributions from the
  community.
