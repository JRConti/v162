title: 'DSTAGNN: Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Aware Graph Neural Network for Traffic Flow
  Forecasting'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: As a typical problem in time series analysis, traffic flow prediction is
  one of the most important application fields of machine learning. However, achieving
  highly accurate traffic flow prediction is a challenging task, due to the presence
  of complex dynamic spatial-temporal dependencies within a road network. This paper
  proposes a novel Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Aware Graph Neural Network (DSTAGNN) to
  model the complex spatial-temporal interaction in road network. First, considering
  the fact that historical data carries intrinsic dynamic information about the spatial
  structure of road networks, we propose a new dynamic spatial-temporal aware graph
  based on a data-driven strategy to replace the pre-defined static graph usually
  used in traditional graph convolution. Second, we design a novel graph neural network
  architecture, which can not only represent dynamic spatial relevance among nodes
  with an improved multi-head attention mechanism, but also acquire the wide range
  of dynamic temporal dependency from multi-receptive field features via multi-scale
  gated convolution. Extensive experiments on real-world data sets demonstrate that
  our proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.
