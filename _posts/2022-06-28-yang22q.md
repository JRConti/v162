title: A Study of Face Obfuscation in ImageNet
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Face obfuscation (blurring, mosaicing, etc.) has been shown to be effective
  for privacy protection; nevertheless, object recognition research typically assumes
  access to complete, unobfuscated images. In this paper, we explore the effects of
  face obfuscation on the popular ImageNet challenge visual recognition benchmark.
  Most categories in the ImageNet challenge are not people categories; however, many
  incidental people appear in the images, and their privacy is a concern. We first
  annotate faces in the dataset. Then we demonstrate that face obfuscation has minimal
  impact on the accuracy of recognition models. Concretely, we benchmark multiple
  deep neural networks on obfuscated images and observe that the overall recognition
  accuracy drops only slightly (<= 1.0%). Further, we experiment with transfer learning
  to 4 downstream tasks (object recognition, scene recognition, face attribute classification,
  and object detection) and show that features learned on obfuscated images are equally
  transferable. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of privacy-aware visual recognition,
  improves the highly-used ImageNet challenge benchmark, and suggests an important
  path for future visual datasets. Data and code are available at https://github.com/princetonvisualai/imagenet-face-obfuscation.
