title: Fast Provably Robust Decision Trees and Boosting
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Learning with adversarial robustness has been a challenge in contemporary
  machine learning, and recent years have witnessed increasing attention on robust
  decision trees and ensembles, mostly working with high computational complexity
  or without guarantees of provable robustness. This work proposes the Fast Provably
  Robust Decision Tree (FPRDT) with the smallest computational complexity O(n log
  n), a tradeoff between global and local optimizations over the adversarial 0/1 loss.
  We further develop the Provably Robust AdaBoost (PRAdaBoost) according to our robust
  decision trees, and present convergence analysis for training adversarial 0/1 loss.
  We conduct extensive experiments to support our approaches; in particular, our approaches
  are superior to those unprovably robust methods, and achieve better or comparable
  performance to those provably robust methods yet with the smallest running time.
