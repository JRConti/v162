title: Deep Network Approximation in Terms of Intrinsic Parameters
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: One of the arguments to explain the success of deep learning is the powerful
  approximation capacity of deep neural networks. Such capacity is generally accompanied
  by the explosive growth of the number of parameters, which, in turn, leads to high
  computational costs. It is of great interest to ask whether we can achieve successful
  deep learning with a small number of learnable parameters adapting to the target
  function. From an approximation perspective, this paper shows that the number of
  parameters that need to be learned can be significantly smaller than people typically
  expect. First, we theoretically design ReLU networks with a few learnable parameters
  to achieve an attractive approximation. We prove by construction that, for any Lipschitz
  continuous function $f$ on $[0,1]^d$ with a Lipschitz constant $\lambda>0$, a ReLU
  network with $n+2$ intrinsic parameters (those depending on $f$) can approximate
  $f$ with an exponentially small error $5 \lambda \sqrt{d} \, 2^{-n}$. Such a result
  is generalized to generic continuous functions. Furthermore, we show that the idea
  of learning a small number of parameters to achieve a good approximation can be
  numerically observed. We conduct several experiments to verify that training a small
  part of parameters can also achieve good results for classification problems if
  other parameters are pre-specified or pre-trained from a related problem.
