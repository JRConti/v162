title: Scalable Deep Gaussian Markov Random Fields for General Graphs
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Machine learning methods on graphs have proven useful in many applications
  due to their ability to handle generally structured data. The framework of Gaussian
  Markov Random Fields (GMRFs) provides a principled way to define Gaussian models
  on graphs by utilizing their sparsity structure. We propose a flexible GMRF model
  for general graphs built on the multi-layer structure of Deep GMRFs, originally
  proposed for lattice graphs only. By designing a new type of layer we enable the
  model to scale to large graphs. The layer is constructed to allow for efficient
  training using variational inference and existing software frameworks for Graph
  Neural Networks. For a Gaussian likelihood, close to exact Bayesian inference is
  available for the latent field. This allows for making predictions with accompanying
  uncertainty estimates. The usefulness of the proposed model is verified by experiments
  on a number of synthetic and real world datasets, where it compares favorably to
  other both Bayesian and deep learning methods.
