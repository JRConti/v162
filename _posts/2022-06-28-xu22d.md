title: Accurate Quantization of Measures via Interacting Particle-based Optimization
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Approximating a target probability distribution can be cast as an optimization
  problem where the objective functional measures the dissimilarity to the target.
  This optimization can be addressed by approximating Wasserstein and related gradient
  flows. In practice, these are simulated by interacting particle systems, whose stationary
  states define an empirical measure approximating the target distribution. This approach
  has been popularized recently to design sampling algorithms, e.g. Stein Variational
  Gradient Descent, or by minimizing the Maximum Mean or Kernel Stein Discrepancy.
  However, little is known about quantization properties of these approaches, i.e.
  how well is the target approximated by a finite number particles. We investigate
  this question theoretically and numerically. In particular, we prove general upper
  bounds on the quantization error of MMD and KSD at rates which significantly outperform
  quantization by i.i.d. samples. We conduct experiments which show that the particle
  systems at study achieve fast rates in practice, and notably outperform greedy algorithms,
  such as kernel herding. We compare different gradient flows and highlight their
  quantization rates. Furthermore we introduce a Normalized Stein Variational Gradient
  Descent and argue in favor of adaptive kernels, which exhibit faster convergence.
  Finally we compare the Gaussian and Laplace kernels and argue that the Laplace kernel
  provides a more robust quantization.
