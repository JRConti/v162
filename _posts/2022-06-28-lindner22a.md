title: Interactively Learning Preference Constraints in Linear Bandits
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We study sequential decision-making with known rewards and unknown constraints,
  motivated by situations where the constraints represent expensive-to-evaluate human
  preferences, such as safe and comfortable driving behavior. We formalize the challenge
  of interactively learning about these constraints as a novel linear bandit problem
  which we call constrained linear best-arm identification. To solve this problem,
  we propose the Adaptive Constraint Learning (ACOL) algorithm. We provide an instance-dependent
  lower bound for constrained linear best-arm identification and show that ACOL’s
  sample complexity matches the lower bound in the worst-case. In the average case,
  ACOL’s sample complexity bound is still significantly tighter than bounds of simpler
  approaches. In synthetic experiments, ACOL performs on par with an oracle solution
  and outperforms a range of baselines. As an application, we consider learning constraints
  to represent human preferences in a driving simulation. ACOL is significantly more
  sample efficient than alternatives for this application. Further, we find that learning
  preferences as constraints is more robust to changes in the driving scenario than
  encoding the preferences directly in the reward function.
