abstract: Incomplete multi-view clustering is a significant but challenging task.
  Although jointly imputing incomplete samples and conducting clustering has been
  shown to achieve promising performance, learning from both complete and incomplete
  data may be worse than learning only from complete data, particularly when imputed
  views are semantic inconsistent with missing views. To address this issue, we propose
  a novel framework to reduce the clustering performance degradation risk from semantic
  inconsistent imputed views. Concretely, by the proposed bi-level optimization framework,
  missing views are dynamically imputed from the learned semantic neighbors, and imputed
  samples are automatically selected for training. In theory, the empirical risk of
  the model is no higher than learning only from complete data, and the model is never
  worse than learning only from complete data in terms of expected risk with high
  probability. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
  superior performance and efficient safe incomplete multi-view clustering.
