title: Faster Fundamental Graph Algorithms via Learned Predictions
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'We consider the question of speeding up classic graph algorithms with machine-learned
  predictions. In this model, algorithms are furnished with extra advice learned from
  past or similar instances. Given the additional information, we aim to improve upon
  the traditional worst-case run-time guarantees. Our contributions are the following:
  (i) We give a faster algorithm for minimum-weight bipartite matching via learned
  duals, improving the recent result by Dinitz, Im, Lavastida, Moseley and Vassilvitskii
  (NeurIPS, 2021); (ii) We extend the learned dual approach to the single-source shortest
  path problem (with negative edge lengths), achieving an almost linear runtime given
  sufficiently accurate predictions which improves upon the classic fastest algorithm
  due to Goldberg (SIAM J. Comput., 1995); (iii) We provide a general reduction-based
  framework for learning-based graph algorithms, leading to new algorithms for degree-constrained
  subgraph and minimum-cost 0-1 flow, based on reductions to bipartite matching and
  the shortest path problem. Finally, we give a set of general learnability theorems,
  showing that the predictions required by our algorithms can be efficiently learned
  in a PAC fashion.'
