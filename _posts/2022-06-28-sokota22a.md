title: Communicating via Markov Decision Processes
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We consider the problem of communicating exogenous information by means
  of Markov decision process trajectories. This setting, which we call a Markov coding
  game (MCG), generalizes both source coding and a large class of referential games.
  MCGs also isolate a problem that is important in decentralized control settings
  in which cheap-talk is not availableâ€”namely, they require balancing communication
  with the associated cost of communicating. We contribute a theoretically grounded
  approach to MCGs based on maximum entropy reinforcement learning and minimum entropy
  coupling that we call MEME. Due to recent breakthroughs in approximation algorithms
  for minimum entropy coupling, MEME is not merely a theoretical algorithm, but can
  be applied to practical settings. Empirically, we show both that MEME is able to
  outperform a strong baseline on small MCGs and that MEME is able to achieve strong
  performance on extremely large MCGs. To the latter point, we demonstrate that MEME
  is able to losslessly communicate binary images via trajectories of Cartpole and
  Pong, while simultaneously achieving the maximal or near maximal expected returns,
  and that it is even capable of performing well in the presence of actuator noise.
