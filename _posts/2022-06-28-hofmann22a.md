title: Unsupervised Detection of Contextualized Embedding Bias with Application to
  Ideology
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'We propose a fully unsupervised method to detect bias in contextualized
  embeddings. The method leverages the assortative information latently encoded by
  social networks and combines orthogonality regularization, structured sparsity learning,
  and graph neural networks to find the embedding subspace capturing this information.
  As a concrete example, we focus on the phenomenon of ideological bias: we introduce
  the concept of an ideological subspace, show how it can be found by applying our
  method to online discussion forums, and present techniques to probe it. Our experiments
  suggest that the ideological subspace encodes abstract evaluative semantics and
  reflects changes in the political left-right spectrum during the presidency of Donald
  Trump.'
