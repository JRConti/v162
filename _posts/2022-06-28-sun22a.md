title: 'AGNAS: Attention-Guided Micro and Macro-Architecture Search'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Micro- and macro-architecture search have emerged as two popular NAS paradigms
  recently. Existing methods leverage different search strategies for searching micro-
  and macro- architectures. When using architecture parameters to search for micro-structure
  such as normal cell and reduction cell, the architecture parameters can not fully
  reflect the corresponding operation importance. When searching for the macro-structure
  chained by pre-defined blocks, many sub-networks need to be sampled for evaluation,
  which is very time-consuming. To address the two issues, we propose a new search
  paradigm, that is, leverage the attention mechanism to guide the micro- and macro-architecture
  search, namely AGNAS. Specifically, we introduce an attention module and plug it
  behind each candidate operation or each candidate block. We utilize the attention
  weights to represent the importance of the relevant operations for the micro search
  or the importance of the relevant blocks for the macro search. Experimental results
  show that AGNAS can achieve 2.46% test error on CIFAR-10 in the DARTS search space,
  and 23.4% test error when directly searching on ImageNet in the ProxylessNAS search
  space. AGNAS also achieves optimal performance on NAS-Bench-201, outperforming state-of-the-art
  approaches. The source code can be available at https://github.com/Sunzh1996/AGNAS.
