title: Active Sampling for Min-Max Fairness
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We propose simple active sampling and reweighting strategies for optimizing
  min-max fairness that can be applied to any classification or regression model learned
  via loss minimization. The key intuition behind our approach is to use at each timestep
  a datapoint from the group that is worst off under the current model for updating
  the model. The ease of implementation and the generality of our robust formulation
  make it an attractive option for improving model performance on disadvantaged groups.
  For convex learning problems, such as linear or logistic regression, we provide
  a fine-grained analysis, proving the rate of convergence to a min-max fair solution.
