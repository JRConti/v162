title: Exact Optimal Accelerated Complexity for Fixed-Point Iterations
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Despite the broad use of fixed-point iterations throughout applied mathematics,
  the optimal convergence rate of general fixed-point problems with nonexpansive nonlinear
  operators has not been established. This work presents an acceleration mechanism
  for fixed-point iterations with nonexpansive operators, contractive operators, and
  nonexpansive operators satisfying a HÃ¶lder-type growth condition. We then provide
  matching complexity lower bounds to establish the exact optimality of the acceleration
  mechanisms in the nonexpansive and contractive setups. Finally, we provide experiments
  with CT imaging, optimal transport, and decentralized optimization to demonstrate
  the practical effectiveness of the acceleration mechanism.
