title: Policy Diagnosis via Measuring Role Diversity in Cooperative Multi-agent RL
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is making rapid progress
  for solving tasks in a grid world and real-world scenarios, in which agents are
  given different attributes and goals, resulting in different behavior through the
  whole multi-agent task. In this study, we quantify the agentâ€™s behavior difference
  and build its relationship with the policy performance via {\bf Role Diversity},
  a metric to measure the characteristics of MARL tasks. We define role diversity
  from three perspectives: action-based, trajectory-based, and contribution-based
  to fully measure a multi-agent task. Through theoretical analysis, we find that
  the error bound in MARL can be decomposed into three parts that have a strong relation
  to the role diversity. The decomposed factors can significantly impact policy optimization
  in three popular directions including parameter sharing, communication mechanism,
  and credit assignment. The main experimental platforms are based on {\bf Multiagent
  Particle Environment (MPE) }and {\bf The StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC)}.
  Extensive experiments clearly show that role diversity can serve as a robust measurement
  for the characteristics of a multi-agent cooperation task and help diagnose whether
  the policy fits the current multi-agent system for better policy performance.'
