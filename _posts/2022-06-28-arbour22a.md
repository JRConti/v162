title: Online Balanced Experimental Design
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We consider the experimental design problem in an online environment, an
  important practical task for reducing the variance of estimates in randomized experiments
  which allows for greater precision, and in turn, improved decision making. In this
  work, we present algorithms that build on recent advances in online discrepancy
  minimization which accommodate both arbitrary treatment probabilities and multiple
  treatments. The proposed algorithms are computational efficient, minimize covariate
  imbalance, and include randomization which enables robustness to misspecification.
  We provide worst case bounds on the expected mean squared error of the causal estimate
  and show that the proposed estimator is no worse than an implicit ridge regression,
  which are within a logarithmic factor of the best known results for offline experimental
  design. We conclude with a detailed simulation study showing favorable results relative
  to complete randomization as well as to offline methods for experimental design
  with time complexities exceeding our algorithm, which has a linear dependence on
  the number of observations, by polynomial factors.
