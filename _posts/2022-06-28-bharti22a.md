title: Approximate Bayesian Computation with Domain Expert in the Loop
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is a popular likelihood-free inference
  method for models with intractable likelihood functions. As ABC methods usually
  rely on comparing summary statistics of observed and simulated data, the choice
  of the statistics is crucial. This choice involves a trade-off between loss of information
  and dimensionality reduction, and is often determined based on domain knowledge.
  However, handcrafting and selecting suitable statistics is a laborious task involving
  multiple trial-and-error steps. In this work, we introduce an active learning method
  for ABC statistics selection which reduces the domain expertâ€™s work considerably.
  By involving the experts, we are able to handle misspecified models, unlike the
  existing dimension reduction methods. Moreover, empirical results show better posterior
  estimates than with existing methods, when the simulation budget is limited.
