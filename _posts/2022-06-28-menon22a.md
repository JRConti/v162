title: In defense of dual-encoders for neural ranking
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Transformer-based models such as BERT have proven successful in information
  retrieval problem, which seek to identify relevant documents for a given query.
  There are two broad flavours of such models: cross-attention (CA) models, which
  learn a joint embedding for the query and document, and dual-encoder (DE) models,
  which learn separate embeddings for the query and document. Empirically, CA models
  are often found to be more accurate, which has motivated a series of works seeking
  to bridge this gap. However, a more fundamental question remains less explored:
  does this performance gap reflect an inherent limitation in the capacity of DE models,
  or a limitation in the training of such models? And does such an understanding suggest
  a principled means of improving DE models? In this paper, we study these questions,
  with three contributions. First, we establish theoretically that with a sufficiently
  large embedding dimension, DE models have the capacity to model a broad class of
  score distributions. Second, we show empirically that on real-world problems, DE
  models may overfit to spurious correlations in the training set, and thus under-perform
  on test samples. To mitigate this behaviour, we propose a suitable distillation
  strategy, and confirm its practical efficacy on the MSMARCO-Passage and Natural
  Questions benchmarks.'
