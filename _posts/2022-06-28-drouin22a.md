title: 'TACTiS: Transformer-Attentional Copulas for Time Series'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'The estimation of time-varying quantities is a fundamental component of
  decision making in fields such as healthcare and finance. However, the practical
  utility of such estimates is limited by how accurately they quantify predictive
  uncertainty. In this work, we address the problem of estimating the joint predictive
  distribution of high-dimensional multivariate time series. We propose a versatile
  method, based on the transformer architecture, that estimates joint distributions
  using an attention-based decoder that provably learns to mimic the properties of
  non-parametric copulas. The resulting model has several desirable properties: it
  can scale to hundreds of time series, supports both forecasting and interpolation,
  can handle unaligned and non-uniformly sampled data, and can seamlessly adapt to
  missing data during training. We demonstrate these properties empirically and show
  that our model produces state-of-the-art predictions on multiple real-world datasets.'
