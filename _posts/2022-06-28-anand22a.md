title: Online Algorithms with Multiple Predictions
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: This paper studies online algorithms augmented with <em>multiple</em> machine-learned
  predictions. We give a generic algorithmic framework for online covering problems
  with multiple predictions that obtains an online solution that is competitive against
  the performance of the <em>best</em> solution obtained from the predictions. Our
  algorithm incorporates the use of predictions in the classic potential-based analysis
  of online algorithms. We apply our algorithmic framework to solve classical problems
  such as online set cover, (weighted) caching, and online facility location in the
  multiple predictions setting.
