title: 'AutoIP: A United Framework to Integrate Physics into Gaussian Processes'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Physical modeling is critical for many modern science and engineering applications.
  From a data science or machine learning perspective, where more domain-agnostic,
  data-driven models are pervasive, physical knowledge {—} often expressed as differential
  equations {—} is valuable in that it is complementary to data, and it can potentially
  help overcome issues such as data sparsity, noise, and inaccuracy. In this work,
  we propose a simple, yet powerful and general framework {—} AutoIP, for Automatically
  Incorporating Physics {—} that can integrate all kinds of differential equations
  into Gaussian Processes (GPs) to enhance prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification.
  These equations can be linear or nonlinear, spatial, temporal, or spatio-temporal,
  complete or incomplete with unknown source terms, and so on. Based on kernel differentiation,
  we construct a GP prior to sample the values of the target function, equation related
  derivatives, and latent source functions, which are all jointly from a multivariate
  Gaussian distribution. The sampled values are fed to two likelihoods: one to fit
  the observations, and the other to conform to the equation. We use the whitening
  method to evade the strong dependency between the sampled function values and kernel
  parameters, and we develop a stochastic variational learning algorithm. AutoIP shows
  improvement upon vanilla GPs in both simulation and several real-world applications,
  even using rough, incomplete equations.'
