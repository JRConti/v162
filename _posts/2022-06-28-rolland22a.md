title: Score Matching Enables Causal Discovery of Nonlinear Additive Noise Models
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: This paper demonstrates how to recover causal graphs from the score of the
  data distribution in non-linear additive (Gaussian) noise models. Using score matching
  algorithms as a building block, we show how to design a new generation of scalable
  causal discovery methods. To showcase our approach, we also propose a new efficient
  method for approximating the score’s Jacobian, enabling to recover the causal graph.
  Empirically, we find that the new algorithm, called SCORE, is competitive with state-of-the-art
  causal discovery methods while being significantly faster.
