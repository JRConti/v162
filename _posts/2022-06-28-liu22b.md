title: Constrained Variational Policy Optimization for Safe Reinforcement Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Safe reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn policies that satisfy certain
  constraints before deploying them to safety-critical applications. Previous primal-dual
  style approaches suffer from instability issues and lack optimality guarantees.
  This paper overcomes the issues from the perspective of probabilistic inference.
  We introduce a novel Expectation-Maximization approach to naturally incorporate
  constraints during the policy learning: 1) a provable optimal non-parametric variational
  distribution could be computed in closed form after a convex optimization (E-step);
  2) the policy parameter is improved within the trust region based on the optimal
  variational distribution (M-step). The proposed algorithm decomposes the safe RL
  problem into a convex optimization phase and a supervised learning phase, which
  yields a more stable training performance. A wide range of experiments on continuous
  robotic tasks shows that the proposed method achieves significantly better constraint
  satisfaction performance and better sample efficiency than baselines. The code is
  available at https://github.com/liuzuxin/cvpo-safe-rl.'
