title: A Dynamical System Perspective for Lipschitz Neural Networks
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The Lipschitz constant of neural networks has been established as a key
  quantity to enforce the robustness to adversarial examples. In this paper, we tackle
  the problem of building $1$-Lipschitz Neural Networks. By studying Residual Networks
  from a continuous time dynamical system perspective, we provide a generic method
  to build $1$-Lipschitz Neural Networks and show that some previous approaches are
  special cases of this framework. Then, we extend this reasoning and show that ResNet
  flows derived from convex potentials define $1$-Lipschitz transformations, that
  lead us to define the <em>Convex Potential Layer</em> (CPL). A comprehensive set
  of experiments on several datasets demonstrates the scalability of our architecture
  and the benefits as an $\ell_2$-provable defense against adversarial examples. Our
  code is available at \url{https://github.com/MILES-PSL/Convex-Potential-Layer}
