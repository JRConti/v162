title: Residual-Based Sampling for Online Outlier-Robust PCA
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Outlier-robust principal component analysis (ORPCA) has been broadly applied
  in scientific discovery in the last decades. In this paper, we study online ORPCA,
  an important variant that addresses the practical challenge that the data points
  arrive in a sequential manner and the goal is to recover the underlying subspace
  of the clean data with one pass of the data. Our main contribution is the first
  provable algorithm that enjoys comparable recovery guarantee to the best known batch
  algorithm, while significantly improving upon the state-of-the-art online ORPCA
  algorithms. The core technique is a robust version of the residual norm which, informally
  speaking, leverages not only the importance of a data point, but also how likely
  it behaves as an outlier.
