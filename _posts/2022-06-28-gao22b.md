title: Loss Function Learning for Domain Generalization by Implicit Gradient
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Generalising robustly to distribution shift is a major challenge that is
  pervasive across most real-world applications of machine learning. A recent study
  highlighted that many advanced algorithms proposed to tackle such domain generalisation
  (DG) fail to outperform a properly tuned empirical risk minimisation (ERM) baseline.
  We take a different approach, and explore the impact of the ERM loss function on
  out-of-domain generalisation. In particular, we introduce a novel meta-learning
  approach to loss function search based on implicit gradient. This enables us to
  discover a general purpose parametric loss function that provides a drop-in replacement
  for cross-entropy. Our loss can be used in standard training pipelines to efficiently
  train robust models using any neural architecture on new datasets. The results show
  that it clearly surpasses cross-entropy, enables simple ERM to outperform some more
  complicated prior DG methods, and provides state-of-the-art performance across a
  variety of DG benchmarks. Furthermore, unlike most existing DG approaches, our setup
  applies to the most practical setting of single-source domain generalisation, on
  which we show significant improvement.
