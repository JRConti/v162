abstract: Douglas-Rachford splitting/ADMM (henceforth DRS) is a very popular algorithm
  for solving convex optimisation problems to low or moderate accuracy, and in particular
  for solving large-scale linear programs. Despite recent progress, obtaining highly
  accurate solutions to linear programs with DRS remains elusive. In this paper we
  analyze the local linear convergence rate $r$ of the DRS method for random linear
  programs, and give explicit and tight bounds on $r$. We show that $1-r^2$ is typically
  of the order of $m^{-1}(n-m)^{-1}$, where $n$ is the number of variables and $m$
  is the number of constraints. This provides a quantitative explanation for the very
  slow convergence of DRS/ADMM on random LPs. The proof of our result relies on an
  established characterisation of the linear rate of convergence as the cosine of
  the Friedrichs angle between two subspaces associated to the problem. We also show
  that the cosecant of this angle can be interpreted as a condition number for the
  LP. The proof of our result relies on a characterization of the linear rate of convergence
  as the cosine of the Friedrichs angle between two subspaces associated to the problem.
  We also show that the cosecant of this angle can be interpreted as a condition number
  for the LP.
