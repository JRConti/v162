title: Global Optimization of K-Center Clustering
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: "$k$-center problem is a well-known clustering method and can be formulated
  as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. This work provides a practical
  global optimization algorithm for this task based on a reduced-space spatial branch
  and bound scheme. This algorithm can guarantee convergence to the global optimum
  by only branching on the centers of clusters, which is independent of the datasetâ€™s
  cardinality. In addition, a set of feasibility-based bounds tightening techniques
  are proposed to narrow down the domain of centers and significantly accelerate the
  convergence. To demonstrate the capacity of this algorithm, we present computational
  results on 32 datasets. Notably, for the dataset with 14 million samples and 3 features,
  the serial implementation of the algorithm can converge to an optimality gap of
  0.1% within 2 hours. Compared with a heuristic method, the global optimum obtained
  by our algorithm can reduce the objective function on average by 30.4%."
