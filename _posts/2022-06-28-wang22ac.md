title: Understanding Instance-Level Impact of Fairness Constraints
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: A variety of fairness constraints have been proposed in the literature to
  mitigate group-level statistical bias. Their impacts have been largely evaluated
  for different groups of populations corresponding to a set of sensitive attributes,
  such as race or gender. Nonetheless, the community has not observed sufficient explorations
  for how imposing fairness constraints fare at an instance level. Building on the
  concept of influence function, a measure that characterizes the impact of a training
  example on the target model and its predictive performance, this work studies the
  influence of training examples when fairness constraints are imposed. We find out
  that under certain assumptions, the influence function with respect to fairness
  constraints can be decomposed into a kernelized combination of training examples.
  One promising application of the proposed fairness influence function is to identify
  suspicious training examples that may cause model discrimination by ranking their
  influence scores. We demonstrate with extensive experiments that training on a subset
  of weighty data examples leads to lower fairness violations with a trade-off of
  accuracy.
