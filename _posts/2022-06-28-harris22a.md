title: 'Strategic Instrumental Variable Regression: Recovering Causal Relationships
  From Strategic Responses'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'In settings where Machine Learning (ML) algorithms automate or inform consequential
  decisions about people, individual decision subjects are often incentivized to strategically
  modify their observable attributes to receive more favorable predictions. As a result,
  the distribution the assessment rule is trained on may differ from the one it operates
  on in deployment. While such distribution shifts, in general, can hinder accurate
  predictions, our work identifies a unique opportunity associated with shifts due
  to strategic responses: We show that we can use strategic responses effectively
  to recover causal relationships between the observable features and outcomes we
  wish to predict, even under the presence of unobserved confounding variables. Specifically,
  our work establishes a novel connection between strategic responses to ML models
  and instrumental variable (IV) regression by observing that the sequence of deployed
  models can be viewed as an instrument that affects agentsâ€™ observable features but
  does not directly influence their outcomes. We show that our causal recovery method
  can be utilized to improve decision-making across several important criteria: individual
  fairness, agent outcomes, and predictive risk. In particular, we show that if decision
  subjects differ in their ability to modify non-causal attributes, any decision rule
  deviating from the causal coefficients can lead to (potentially unbounded) individual-level
  unfairness. .'
