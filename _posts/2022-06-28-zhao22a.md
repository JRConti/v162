title: 'NysADMM: faster composite convex optimization via low-rank approximation'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'This paper develops a scalable new algorithm, called NysADMM, to minimize
  a smooth convex loss function with a convex regularizer. NysADMM accelerates the
  inexact Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) by constructing a preconditioner
  for the ADMM subproblem from a randomized low-rank Nyström approximation. NysADMM
  comes with strong theoretical guarantees: it solves the ADMM subproblem in a constant
  number of iterations when the rank of the Nyström approximation is the effective
  dimension of the subproblem regularized Gram matrix. In practice, ranks much smaller
  than the effective dimension can succeed, so NysADMM uses an adaptive strategy to
  choose the rank that enjoys analogous guarantees. Numerical experiments on real-world
  datasets demonstrate that NysADMM can solve important applications, such as the
  lasso, logistic regression, and support vector machines, in half the time (or less)
  required by standard solvers. The breadth of problems on which NysADMM beats standard
  solvers is a surprise: it suggests that ADMM is a dominant paradigm for numerical
  optimization across a wide range of statistical learning problems that are usually
  solved with bespoke methods.'
