title: Adversarial Vulnerability of Randomized Ensembles
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Despite the tremendous success of deep neural networks across various tasks,
  their vulnerability to imperceptible adversarial perturbations has hindered their
  deployment in the real world. Recently, works on randomized ensembles have empirically
  demonstrated significant improvements in adversarial robustness over standard adversarially
  trained (AT) models with minimal computational overhead, making them a promising
  solution for safety-critical resource-constrained applications. However, this impressive
  performance raises the question: Are these robustness gains provided by randomized
  ensembles real? In this work we address this question both theoretically and empirically.
  We first establish theoretically that commonly employed robustness evaluation methods
  such as adaptive PGD provide a false sense of security in this setting. Subsequently,
  we propose a theoretically-sound and efficient adversarial attack algorithm (ARC)
  capable of compromising random ensembles even in cases where adaptive PGD fails
  to do so. We conduct comprehensive experiments across a variety of network architectures,
  training schemes, datasets, and norms to support our claims, and empirically establish
  that randomized ensembles are in fact more vulnerable to $\ell_p$-bounded adversarial
  perturbations than even standard AT models. Our code can be found at https://github.com/hsndbk4/ARC.'
