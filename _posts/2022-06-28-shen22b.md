title: Metric-Fair Active Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Active learning has become a prevalent technique for designing label-efficient
  algorithms, where the central principle is to only query and fit “informative” labeled
  instances. It is, however, known that an active learning algorithm may incur unfairness
  due to such instance selection procedure. In this paper, we henceforth study metric-fair
  active learning of homogeneous halfspaces, and show that under the distribution-dependent
  PAC learning model, fairness and label efficiency can be achieved simultaneously.
  We further propose two extensions of our main results: 1) we show that it is possible
  to make the algorithm robust to the adversarial noise – one of the most challenging
  noise models in learning theory; and 2) it is possible to significantly improve
  the label complexity when the underlying halfspace is sparse.'
