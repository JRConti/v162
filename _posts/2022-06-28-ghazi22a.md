title: Faster Privacy Accounting via Evolving Discretization
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We introduce a new algorithm for numerical composition of privacy random
  variables, useful for computing the accurate differential privacy parameters for
  compositions of mechanisms. Our algorithm achieves a running time and memory usage
  of $polylog(k)$ for the task of self-composing a mechanism, from a broad class of
  mechanisms, $k$ times; this class, e.g., includes the sub-sampled Gaussian mechanism,
  that appears in the analysis of differentially private stochastic gradient descent
  (DP-SGD). By comparison, recent work by Gopi et al. (NeurIPS 2021) has obtained
  a running time of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{k})$ for the same task. Our approach extends
  to the case of composing $k$ different mechanisms in the same class, improving upon
  the running time and memory usage in their work from $\widetilde{O}(k^{1.5})$ to
  $\wtilde{O}(k)$.
