title: 'Constrained Gradient Descent: A Powerful and Principled Evasion Attack Against
  Neural Networks'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'We propose new, more efficient targeted white-box attacks against deep
  neural networks. Our attacks better align with the attacker’s goal: (1) tricking
  a model to assign higher probability to the target class than to any other class,
  while (2) staying within an $\epsilon$-distance of the attacked input. First, we
  demonstrate a loss function that explicitly encodes (1) and show that Auto-PGD finds
  more attacks with it. Second, we propose a new attack method, Constrained Gradient
  Descent (CGD), using a refinement of our loss function that captures both (1) and
  (2). CGD seeks to satisfy both attacker objectives—misclassification and bounded
  $\ell_{p}$-norm—in a principled manner, as part of the optimization, instead of
  via ad hoc post-processing techniques (e.g., projection or clipping). We show that
  CGD is more successful on CIFAR10 (0.9–4.2%) and ImageNet (8.6–13.6%) than state-of-the-art
  attacks while consuming less time (11.4–18.8%). Statistical tests confirm that our
  attack outperforms others against leading defenses on different datasets and values
  of $\epsilon$.'
