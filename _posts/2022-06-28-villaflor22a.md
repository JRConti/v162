title: Addressing Optimism Bias in Sequence Modeling for Reinforcement Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Impressive results in natural language processing (NLP) based on the Transformer
  neural network architecture have inspired researchers to explore viewing offline
  reinforcement learning (RL) as a generic sequence modeling problem. Recent works
  based on this paradigm have achieved state-of-the-art results in several of the
  mostly deterministic offline Atari and D4RL benchmarks. However, because these methods
  jointly model the states and actions as a single sequencing problem, they struggle
  to disentangle the effects of the policy and world dynamics on the return. Thus,
  in adversarial or stochastic environments, these methods lead to overly optimistic
  behavior that can be dangerous in safety-critical systems like autonomous driving.
  In this work, we propose a method that addresses this optimism bias by explicitly
  disentangling the policy and world models, which allows us at test time to search
  for policies that are robust to multiple possible futures in the environment. We
  demonstrate our methodâ€™s superior performance on a variety of autonomous driving
  tasks in simulation.
