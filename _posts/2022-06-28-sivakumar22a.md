title: Smoothed Adversarial Linear Contextual Bandits with Knapsacks
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Many bandit problems are characterized by the learner making decisions under
  constraints. The learner in Linear Contextual Bandits with Knapsacks (LinCBwK) receives
  a resource consumption vector in addition to a scalar reward in each time step which
  are both linear functions of the context corresponding to the chosen arm. For a
  fixed time horizon $T$, the goal of the learner is to maximize rewards while ensuring
  resource consumptions do not exceed a pre-specified budget. We present algorithms
  and characterize regret for LinCBwK in the smoothed setting where base context vectors
  are assumed to be perturbed by Gaussian noise. We consider both the stochastic and
  adversarial settings for the base contexts, and our analysis of stochastic LinCBwK
  can be viewed as a warm-up to the more challenging adversarial LinCBwK. For the
  stochastic setting, we obtain $O(\sqrt{T})$ additive regret bounds compared to the
  best context dependent fixed policy. The analysis combines ideas for greedy parameter
  estimation in \cite{kmrw18, siwb20} and the primal-dual paradigm first explored
  in \cite{agde17, agde14}. Our main contribution is an algorithm with $O(\log T)$
  competitive ratio relative to the best context dependent fixed policy for the adversarial
  setting. The algorithm for the adversarial setting employs ideas from the primal-dual
  framework \cite{agde17, agde14} and a novel adaptation of the doubling trick \cite{isss19}.
