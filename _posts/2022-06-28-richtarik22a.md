title: '3PC: Three Point Compressors for Communication-Efficient Distributed Training
  and a Better Theory for Lazy Aggregation'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We propose and study a new class of gradient compressors for communication-efficient
  training—three point compressors (3PC)—as well as efficient distributed nonconvex
  optimization algorithms that can take advantage of them. Unlike most established
  approaches, which rely on a static compressor choice (e.g., TopK), our class allows
  the compressors to <em>evolve</em> throughout the training process, with the aim
  of improving the theoretical communication complexity and practical efficiency of
  the underlying methods. We show that our general approach can recover the recently
  proposed state-of-the-art error feedback mechanism EF21 (Richtárik et al, 2021)
  and its theoretical properties as a special case, but also leads to a number of
  new efficient methods. Notably, our approach allows us to improve upon the state-of-the-art
  in the algorithmic and theoretical foundations of the <em>lazy aggregation</em>
  literature (Liu et al, 2017; Lan et al, 2017). As a by-product that may be of independent
  interest, we provide a new and fundamental link between the lazy aggregation and
  error feedback literature. A special feature of our work is that we do not require
  the compressors to be unbiased.
