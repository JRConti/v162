booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Advances in differentiable numerical integrators have enabled the use of
  gradient descent techniques to learn ordinary differential equations (ODEs), where
  a flexible function approximator (often a neural network) is used to estimate the
  system dynamics, given as a time derivative. However, these integrators can be unsatisfactorily
  slow and unstable when learning systems of ODEs from long sequences. We propose
  to learn an ODE of interest from data by viewing its dynamics as a vector field
  related to another base vector field via a diffeomorphism (i.e., a differentiable
  bijection), represented by an invertible neural network (INN). By learning both
  the INN and the dynamics of the base ODE, we provide an avenue to offload some of
  the complexity in modelling the dynamics directly on to the INN. Consequently, by
  restricting the base ODE to be amenable to integration, we can speed up and improve
  the robustness of integrating trajectories from the learned system. We demonstrate
  the efficacy of our method in training and evaluating benchmark ODE systems, as
  well as within continuous-depth neural networks models. We show that our approach
  attains speed-ups of up to two orders of magnitude when integrating learned ODEs.
