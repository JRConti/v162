title: Forward Operator Estimation in Generative Models with Kernel Transfer Operators
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Generative models which use explicit density modeling (e.g., variational
  autoencoders, flow-based generative models) involve finding a mapping from a known
  distribution, e.g. Gaussian, to the unknown input distribution. This often requires
  searching over a class of non-linear functions (e.g., representable by a deep neural
  network). While effective in practice, the associated runtime/memory costs can increase
  rapidly, usually as a function of the performance desired in an application. We
  propose a substantially cheaper (and simpler) forward operator estimation strategy
  based on adapting known results on kernel transfer operators. We show that our formulation
  enables highly efficient distribution approximation and sampling, and offers surprisingly
  good empirical performance that compares favorably with powerful baselines, but
  with significant runtime savings. We show that the algorithm also performs well
  in small sample size settings (in brain imaging).
