title: Model Selection in Batch Policy Optimization
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'We study the problem of model selection in batch policy optimization: given
  a fixed, partial-feedback dataset and M model classes, learn a policy with performance
  that is competitive with the policy derived from the best model class. We formalize
  the problem in the contextual bandit setting with linear model classes by identifying
  three sources of error that any model selection algorithm should optimally trade-off
  in order to be competitive: (1) approximation error, (2) statistical complexity,
  and (3) coverage. The first two sources are common in model selection for supervised
  learning, where optimally trading off these two is well-studied. In contrast, the
  third source is unique to batch policy optimization and is due to dataset shift
  inherent to the setting. We first show that no batch policy optimization algorithm
  can achieve a guarantee addressing all three simultaneously, revealing a stark contrast
  between difficulties in batch policy optimization and the positive results available
  in supervised learning. Despite this negative result, we show that relaxing any
  one of the three error sources enables the design of algorithms achieving near-oracle
  inequalities for the remaining two. We conclude with experiments demonstrating the
  efficacy of these algorithms.'
