title: Constraint-based graph network simulator
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In the area of physical simulations, nearly all neural-network-based methods
  directly predict future states from the input states. However, many traditional
  simulation engines instead model the constraints of the system and select the state
  which satisfies them. Here we present a framework for constraint-based learned simulation,
  where a scalar constraint function is implemented as a graph neural network, and
  future predictions are computed by solving the optimization problem defined by the
  learned constraint. Our model achieves comparable or better accuracy to top learned
  simulators on a variety of challenging physical domains, and offers several unique
  advantages. We can improve the simulation accuracy on a larger system by applying
  more solver iterations at test time. We also can incorporate novel hand-designed
  constraints at test time and simulate new dynamics which were not present in the
  training data. Our constraint-based framework shows how key techniques from traditional
  simulation and numerical methods can be leveraged as inductive biases in machine
  learning simulators.
