title: Generalized Federated Learning via Sharpness Aware Minimization
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a promising framework for performing privacy-preserving,
  distributed learning with a set of clients. However, the data distribution among
  clients often exhibits non-IID, i.e., distribution shift, which makes efficient
  optimization difficult. To tackle this problem, many FL algorithms focus on mitigating
  the effects of data heterogeneity across clients by increasing the performance of
  the global model. However, almost all algorithms leverage Empirical Risk Minimization
  (ERM) to be the local optimizer, which is easy to make the global model fall into
  a sharp valley and increase a large deviation of parts of local clients. Therefore,
  in this paper, we revisit the solutions to the distribution shift problem in FL
  with a focus on local learning generality. To this end, we propose a general, effective
  algorithm, \texttt{FedSAM}, based on Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM) local optimizer,
  and develop a momentum FL algorithm to bridge local and global models, \texttt{MoFedSAM}.
  Theoretically, we show the convergence analysis of these two algorithms and demonstrate
  the generalization bound of \texttt{FedSAM}. Empirically, our proposed algorithms
  substantially outperform existing FL studies and significantly decrease the learning
  deviation.
