title: Achieving Fairness at No Utility Cost via Data Reweighing with Influence
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: With the fast development of algorithmic governance, fairness has become
  a compulsory property for machine learning models to suppress unintentional discrimination.
  In this paper, we focus on the pre-processing aspect for achieving fairness, and
  propose a data reweighing approach that only adjusts the weight for samples in the
  training phase. Different from most previous reweighing methods which usually assign
  a uniform weight for each (sub)group, we granularly model the influence of each
  training sample with regard to fairness-related quantity and predictive utility,
  and compute individual weights based on influence under the constraints from both
  fairness and utility. Experimental results reveal that previous methods achieve
  fairness at a non-negligible cost of utility, while as a significant advantage,
  our approach can empirically release the tradeoff and obtain cost-free fairness
  for equal opportunity. We demonstrate the cost-free fairness through vanilla classifiers
  and standard training processes, compared to baseline methods on multiple real-world
  tabular datasets. Code available at https://github.com/brandeis-machine-learning/influence-fairness.
