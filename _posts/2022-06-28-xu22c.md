title: Detached Error Feedback for Distributed SGD with Random Sparsification
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The communication bottleneck has been a critical problem in large-scale
  distributed deep learning. In this work, we study distributed SGD with random block-wise
  sparsification as the gradient compressor, which is ring-allreduce compatible and
  highly computation-efficient but leads to inferior performance. To tackle this important
  issue, we improve the communication-efficient distributed SGD from a novel aspect,
  that is, the trade-off between the variance and second moment of the gradient. With
  this motivation, we propose a new detached error feedback (DEF) algorithm, which
  shows better convergence bound than error feedback for non-convex problems. We also
  propose DEF-A to accelerate the generalization of DEF at the early stages of the
  training, which shows better generalization bounds than DEF. Furthermore, we establish
  the connection between communication-efficient distributed SGD and SGD with iterate
  averaging (SGD-IA) for the first time. Extensive deep learning experiments show
  significant empirical improvement of the proposed methods under various settings.
  Our reproducible codes and scripts for all experiments in this work will be made
  publicly available.
