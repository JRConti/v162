title: RUMs from Head-to-Head Contests
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Random utility models (RUMs) encode the likelihood that a particular item
  will be selected from a slate of competing items. RUMs are well-studied objects
  in both discrete choice theory and, more recently, in the machine learning community,
  as they encode a fairly broad notion of rational user behavior. In this paper, we
  focus on slates of size two representing head-to-head contests. Given a tournament
  matrix $M$ such that $M_{i,j}$ is the probability that item $j$ will be selected
  from $\{i, j\}$, we consider the problem of finding the RUM that most closely reproduces
  $M$. For this problem we obtain a polynomial-time algorithm returning a RUM that
  approximately minimizes the average error over the pairs. Our experiments show that
  RUMs can <em>perfectly</em> represent many of the tournament matrices that have
  been considered in the literature; in fact, the maximum average error induced by
  RUMs on the matrices we considered is negligible ($\approx 0.001$). We also show
  that RUMs are competitive, on prediction tasks, with previous approaches.
