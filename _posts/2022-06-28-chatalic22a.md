title: Nyström Kernel Mean Embeddings
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Kernel mean embeddings are a powerful tool to represent probability distributions
  over arbitrary spaces as single points in a Hilbert space. Yet, the cost of computing
  and storing such embeddings prohibits their direct use in large-scale settings.
  We propose an efficient approximation procedure based on the Nystr{ö}m method, which
  exploits a small random subset of the dataset. Our main result is an upper bound
  on the approximation error of this procedure. It yields sufficient conditions on
  the subsample size to obtain the standard (1/sqrt(n)) rate while reducing computational
  costs. We discuss applications of this result for the approximation of the maximum
  mean discrepancy and quadrature rules, and we illustrate our theoretical findings
  with numerical experiments.
