title: Information Discrepancy in Strategic Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'We initiate the study of the effects of non-transparency in decision rules
  on individuals’ ability to improve in strategic learning settings. Inspired by real-life
  settings, such as loan approvals and college admissions, we remove the assumption
  typically made in the strategic learning literature, that the decision rule is fully
  known to individuals, and focus instead on settings where it is inaccessible. In
  their lack of knowledge, individuals try to infer this rule by learning from their
  peers (e.g., friends and acquaintances who previously applied for a loan), naturally
  forming groups in the population, each with possibly different type and level of
  information regarding the decision rule. We show that, in equilibrium, the principal’s
  decision rule optimizing welfare across sub-populations may cause a strong negative
  externality: the true quality of some of the groups can actually deteriorate. On
  the positive side, we show that, in many natural cases, optimal improvement can
  be guaranteed simultaneously for all sub-populations. We further introduce a measure
  we term information overlap proxy, and demonstrate its usefulness in characterizing
  the disparity in improvements across sub-populations. Finally, we identify a natural
  condition under which improvement can be guaranteed for all sub-populations while
  maintaining high predictive accuracy. We complement our theoretical analysis with
  experiments on real-world datasets.'
