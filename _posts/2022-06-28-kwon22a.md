abstract: 'Motivated by online recommendation systems, we propose the problem of finding
  the optimal policy in multitask contextual bandits when a small fraction $\alpha
  < 1/2$ of tasks (users) are arbitrary and adversarial. The remaining fraction of
  good users share the same instance of contextual bandits with $S$ contexts and $A$
  actions (items). Naturally, whether a user is good or adversarial is not known in
  advance. The goal is to robustly learn the policy that maximizes rewards for good
  users with as few user interactions as possible. Without adversarial users, established
  results in collaborative filtering show that $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ per-user interactions
  suffice to learn a good policy, precisely because information can be shared across
  users. This parallelization gain is fundamentally altered by the presence of adversarial
  users: unless there are super-polynomial number of users, we show a lower bound
  of $\tilde{\Omega}(\min(S,A) \cdot \alpha^2 / \epsilon^2)$ <em>per-user</em> interactions
  to learn an $\epsilon$-optimal policy for the good users. We then show we can achieve
  an $\tilde{O}(\min(S,A)\cdot \alpha/\epsilon^2)$ upper-bound, by employing efficient
  robust mean estimators for both uni-variate and high-dimensional random variables.
  We also show that this can be improved depending on the distributions of contexts.'
