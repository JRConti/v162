title: Zero-Shot Reward Specification via Grounded Natural Language
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Reward signals in reinforcement learning are expensive to design and often
  require access to the true state which is not available in the real world. Common
  alternatives are usually demonstrations or goal images which can be labor-intensive
  to collect. On the other hand, text descriptions provide a general, natural, and
  low-effort way of communicating the desired task. However, prior works in learning
  text-conditioned policies still rely on rewards that are defined using either true
  state or labeled expert demonstrations. We use recent developments in building large-scale
  visuolanguage models like CLIP to devise a framework that generates the task reward
  signal just from goal text description and raw pixel observations which is then
  used to learn the task policy. We evaluate the proposed framework on control and
  robotic manipulation tasks. Finally, we distill the individual task policies into
  a single goal text conditioned policy that can generalize in a zero-shot manner
  to new tasks with unseen objects and unseen goal text descriptions.
