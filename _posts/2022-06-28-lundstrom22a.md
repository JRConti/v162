title: A Rigorous Study of Integrated Gradients Method and Extensions to Internal
  Neuron Attributions
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'As deep learning (DL) efficacy grows, concerns for poor model explainability
  grow also. Attribution methods address the issue of explainability by quantifying
  the importance of an input feature for a model prediction. Among various methods,
  Integrated Gradients (IG) sets itself apart by claiming other methods failed to
  satisfy desirable axioms, while IG and methods like it uniquely satisfy said axioms.
  This paper comments on fundamental aspects of IG and its applications/extensions:
  1) We identify key differences between IG function spaces and the supporting literatureâ€™s
  function spaces which problematize previous claims of IG uniqueness. We show that
  with the introduction of an additional axiom, non-decreasing positivity, the uniqueness
  claims can be established. 2) We address the question of input sensitivity by identifying
  function classes where IG is/is not Lipschitz in the attributed input. 3) We show
  that axioms for single-baseline methods have analogous properties for methods with
  probability distribution baselines. 4) We introduce a computationally efficient
  method of identifying internal neurons that contribute to specified regions of an
  IG attribution map. Finally, we present experimental results validating this method.'
