  Forecasting'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Long-term time series forecasting is challenging since prediction accuracy
  tends to decrease dramatically with the increasing horizon. Although Transformer-based
  methods have significantly improved state-of-the-art results for long-term forecasting,
  they are not only computationally expensive but more importantly, are unable to
  capture the global view of time series (e.g. overall trend). To address these problems,
  we propose to combine Transformer with the seasonal-trend decomposition method,
  in which the decomposition method captures the global profile of time series while
  Transformers capture more detailed structures. To further enhance the performance
  of Transformer for long-term prediction, we exploit the fact that most time series
  tend to have a sparse representation in a well-known basis such as Fourier transform,
  and develop a frequency enhanced Transformer. Besides being more effective, the
  proposed method, termed as Frequency Enhanced Decomposed Transformer (FEDformer),
  is more efficient than standard Transformer with a linear complexity to the sequence
  length. Our empirical studies with six benchmark datasets show that compared with
  state-of-the-art methods, Fedformer can reduce prediction error by 14.8% and 22.6%
  for multivariate and univariate time series, respectively. Code is publicly available
  at https://github.com/MAZiqing/FEDformer.
