title: 'Revisiting Online Submodular Minimization: Gap-Dependent Regret Bounds, Best
  of Both Worlds and Adversarial Robustness'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In this paper, we consider online decision problems with submodular loss
  functions. For such problems, existing studies have only dealt with worst-case analysis.
  This study goes beyond worst-case analysis to show instance-dependent regret bounds.
  More precisely, for each of the full-information and bandit-feedback settings, we
  propose an algorithm that achieves a gap-dependent O(log T)-regret bound in the
  stochastic environment and is comparable to the best existing algorithm in the adversarial
  environment. The proposed algorithms also work well in the stochastic environment
  with adversarial corruptions, which is an intermediate setting between the stochastic
  and adversarial environments.
