title: 'Time Is MattEr: Temporal Self-supervision for Video Transformers'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Understanding temporal dynamics of video is an essential aspect of learning
  better video representations. Recently, transformer-based architectural designs
  have been extensively explored for video tasks due to their capability to capture
  long-term dependency of input sequences. However, we found that these Video Transformers
  are still biased to learn spatial dynamics rather than temporal ones, and debiasing
  the spurious correlation is critical for their performance. Based on the observations,
  we design simple yet effective self-supervised tasks for video models to learn temporal
  dynamics better. Specifically, for debiasing the spatial bias, our method learns
  the temporal order of video frames as extra self-supervision and enforces the randomly
  shuffled frames to have low-confidence outputs. Also, our method learns the temporal
  flow direction of video tokens among consecutive frames for enhancing the correlation
  toward temporal dynamics. Under various video action recognition tasks, we demonstrate
  the effectiveness of our method and its compatibility with state-of-the-art Video
  Transformers.
