title: On the Robustness of CountSketch to Adaptive Inputs
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The last decade saw impressive progress towards understanding the performance
  of algorithms in <em>adaptive</em> settings, where subsequent inputs may depend
  on the output from prior inputs. Adaptive settings arise in processes with feedback
  or with adversarial attacks. Existing designs of robust algorithms are generic wrappers
  of non-robust counterparts and leave open the possibility of better tailored designs.
  The lowers bounds (attacks) are similarly worst-case and their significance to practical
  setting is unclear. Aiming to understand these questions, we study the robustness
  of \texttt{CountSketch}, a popular dimensionality reduction technique that maps
  vectors to a lower dimension using randomized linear measurements. The sketch supports
  recovering $\ell_2$-heavy hitters of a vector (entries with $v[i]^2 \geq \frac{1}{k}\|\boldsymbol{v}\|^2_2$).
  We show that the classic estimator is not robust, and can be attacked with a number
  of queries of the order of the sketch size. We propose a robust estimator (for a
  slightly modified sketch) that allows for quadratic number of queries in the sketch
  size, which is an improvement factor of $\sqrt{k}$ (for $k$ heavy hitters) over
  prior "blackbox" approaches.
