  Online Decision Making

abstract: Differentially private (DP) stochastic convex optimization (SCO) is ubiquitous
  in trustworthy machine learning algorithm design. This paper studies the DP-SCO
  problem with streaming data sampled from a distribution and arrives sequentially.
  We also consider the continual release model where parameters related to private
  information are updated and released upon each new data. Numerous algorithms have
  been developed to achieve optimal excess risks in different $\ell_p$ norm geometries,
  but none of the existing ones can be adapted to the streaming and continual release
  setting. We propose a private variant of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm with recursive
  gradients for variance reduction to update and reveal the parameters upon each data.
  Combined with the adaptive DP analysis, our algorithm achieves the first optimal
  excess risk in linear time in the case $1<p\leq 2$ and the state-of-the-art excess
  risk meeting the non-private lower ones when $2<p\leq \infty$. Our algorithm can
  also be extended to the case $p=1$ to achieve nearly dimension-independent excess
  risk. While previous variance reduction results on recursive gradient have theoretical
  guarantee only in the i.i.d. setting, we establish such a guarantee in a non-stationary
  setting. To demonstrate the virtues of our method, we design the first DP algorithm
  for high-dimensional generalized linear bandits with logarithmic regret.
