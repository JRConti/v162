title: 'Universal Hopfield Networks: A General Framework for Single-Shot Associative
  Memory Models'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'A large number of neural network models of associative memory have been
  proposed in the literature. These include the classical Hopfield networks (HNs),
  sparse distributed memories (SDMs), and more recently the modern continuous Hopfield
  networks (MCHNs), which possess close links with self-attention in machine learning.
  In this paper, we propose a general framework for understanding the operation of
  such memory networks as a sequence of three operations: similarity, separation,
  and projection. We derive all these memory models as instances of our general framework
  with differing similarity and separation functions. We extend the mathematical framework
  of Krotov et al (2020) to express general associative memory models using neural
  network dynamics with local computation, and derive a general energy function that
  is a Lyapunov function of the dynamics. Finally, using our framework, we empirically
  investigate the capacity of using different similarity functions for these associative
  memory models, beyond the dot product similarity measure, and demonstrate empirically
  that Euclidean or Manhattan distance similarity metrics perform substantially better
  in practice on many tasks, enabling a more robust retrieval and higher memory capacity
  than existingÂ models.'
