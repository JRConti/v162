title: Self-Supervised Models of Audio Effectively Explain Human Cortical Responses
  to Speech
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Self-supervised language models are very effective at predicting high-level
  cortical responses during language comprehension. However, the best current models
  of lower-level auditory processing in the human brain rely on either hand-constructed
  acoustic filters or representations from supervised audio neural networks. In this
  work, we capitalize on the progress of self-supervised speech representation learning
  (SSL) to create new state-of-the-art models of the human auditory system. Compared
  against acoustic baselines, phonemic features, and supervised models, representations
  from the middle layers of self-supervised models (APC, wav2vec, wav2vec 2.0, and
  HuBERT) consistently yield the best prediction performance for fMRI recordings within
  the auditory cortex (AC). Brain areas involved in low-level auditory processing
  exhibit a preference for earlier SSL model layers, whereas higher-level semantic
  areas prefer later layers. We show that these trends are due to the modelsâ€™ ability
  to encode information at multiple linguistic levels (acoustic, phonetic, and lexical)
  along their representation depth. Overall, these results show that self-supervised
  models effectively capture the hierarchy of information relevant to different stages
  of speech processing in human cortex.
