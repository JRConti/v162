title: 'Provable Stochastic Optimization for Global Contrastive Learning: Small Batch
  Does Not Harm Performance'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In this paper, we study contrastive learning from an optimization perspective,
  aiming to analyze and address a fundamental issue of existing contrastive learning
  methods that either rely on a large batch size or a large dictionary of feature
  vectors. We consider a global objective for contrastive learning, which contrasts
  each positive pair with all negative pairs for an anchor point. From the optimization
  perspective, we explain why existing methods such as SimCLR require a large batch
  size in order to achieve a satisfactory result. In order to remove such requirement,
  we propose a memory-efficient Stochastic Optimization algorithm for solving the
  Global objective of Contrastive Learning of Representations, named SogCLR. We show
  that its optimization error is negligible under a reasonable condition after a sufficient
  number of iterations or is diminishing for a slightly different global contrastive
  objective. Empirically, we demonstrate that SogCLR with small batch size (e.g.,
  256) can achieve similar performance as SimCLR with large batch size (e.g., 8192)
  on self-supervised learning task on ImageNet-1K. We also attempt to show that the
  proposed optimization technique is generic and can be applied to solving other contrastive
  losses, e.g., two-way contrastive losses for bimodal contrastive learning. The proposed
  method is implemented in our open-sourced library LibAUC (www.libauc.org).
