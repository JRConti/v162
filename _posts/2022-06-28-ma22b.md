title: Quantification and Analysis of Layer-wise and Pixel-wise Information Discarding
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: This paper presents a method to explain how the information of each input
  variable is gradually discarded during the forward propagation in a deep neural
  network (DNN), which provides new perspectives to explain DNNs. We define two types
  of entropy-based metrics, i.e. (1) the discarding of pixel-wise information used
  in the forward propagation, and (2) the uncertainty of the input reconstruction,
  to measure input information contained by a specific layer from two perspectives.
  Unlike previous attribution metrics, the proposed metrics ensure the fairness of
  comparisons between different layers of different DNNs. We can use these metrics
  to analyze the efficiency of information processing in DNNs, which exhibits strong
  connections to the performance of DNNs. We analyze information discarding in a pixel-wise
  manner, which is different from the information bottleneck theory measuring feature
  information w.r.t. the sample distribution. Experiments have shown the effectiveness
  of our metrics in analyzing classic DNNs and explaining existing deep-learning techniques.
