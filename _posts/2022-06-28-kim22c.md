title: Dataset Condensation via Efficient Synthetic-Data Parameterization
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The great success of machine learning with massive amounts of data comes
  at a price of huge computation costs and storage for training and tuning. Recent
  studies on dataset condensation attempt to reduce the dependence on such massive
  data by synthesizing a compact training dataset. However, the existing approaches
  have fundamental limitations in optimization due to the limited representability
  of synthetic datasets without considering any data regularity characteristics. To
  this end, we propose a novel condensation framework that generates multiple synthetic
  data with a limited storage budget via efficient parameterization considering data
  regularity. We further analyze the shortcomings of the existing gradient matching-based
  condensation methods and develop an effective optimization technique for improving
  the condensation of training data information. We propose a unified algorithm that
  drastically improves the quality of condensed data against the current state-of-the-art
  on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and Speech Commands.
