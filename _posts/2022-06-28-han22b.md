title: Scalable MCMC Sampling for Nonsymmetric Determinantal Point Processes
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: A determinantal point process (DPP) is an elegant model that assigns a probability
  to every subset of a collection of $n$ items. While conventionally a DPP is parameterized
  by a symmetric kernel matrix, removing this symmetry constraint, resulting in nonsymmetric
  DPPs (NDPPs), leads to significant improvements in modeling power and predictive
  performance. Recent work has studied an approximate Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
  sampling algorithm for NDPPs restricted to size-$k$ subsets (called $k$-NDPPs).
  However, the runtime of this approach is quadratic in $n$, making it infeasible
  for large-scale settings. In this work, we develop a scalable MCMC sampling algorithm
  for $k$-NDPPs with low-rank kernels, thus enabling runtime that is sublinear in
  $n$. Our method is based on a state-of-the-art NDPP rejection sampling algorithm,
  which we enhance with a novel approach for efficiently constructing the proposal
  distribution. Furthermore, we extend our scalable $k$-NDPP sampling algorithm to
  NDPPs without size constraints. Our resulting sampling method has polynomial time
  complexity in the rank of the kernel, while the existing approach has runtime that
  is exponential in the rank. With both a theoretical analysis and experiments on
  real-world datasets, we verify that our scalable approximate sampling algorithms
  are orders of magnitude faster than existing sampling approaches for $k$-NDPPs and
  NDPPs.
