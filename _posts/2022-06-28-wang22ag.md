title: Generative Coarse-Graining of Molecular Conformations
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Coarse-graining (CG) of molecular simulations simplifies the particle representation
  by grouping selected atoms into pseudo-beads and therefore drastically accelerates
  simulation. However, such CG procedure induces information losses, which makes accurate
  backmapping, i.e., restoring fine-grained (FG) coordinates from CG coordinates,
  a long-standing challenge. Inspired by the recent progress in generative models
  and equivariant networks, we propose a novel model that rigorously embeds the vital
  probabilistic nature and geometrical consistency requirements of the backmapping
  transformation. Our model encodes the FG uncertainties into an invariant latent
  space and decodes them back to FG geometries via equivariant convolutions. To standardize
  the evaluation of this domain, we further provide three comprehensive benchmarks
  based on molecular dynamics trajectories. Extensive experiments show that our approach
  always recovers more realistic structures and outperforms existing data-driven methods
  with a significant margin.
