title: Surrogate Likelihoods for Variational Annealed Importance Sampling
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Variational inference is a powerful paradigm for approximate Bayesian inference
  with a number of appealing properties, including support for model learning and
  data subsampling. By contrast MCMC methods like Hamiltonian Monte Carlo do not share
  these properties but remain attractive since, contrary to parametric methods, MCMC
  is asymptotically unbiased. For these reasons researchers have sought to combine
  the strengths of both classes of algorithms, with recent approaches coming closer
  to realizing this vision in practice. However, supporting data subsampling in these
  hybrid methods can be a challenge, a shortcoming that we address by introducing
  a surrogate likelihood that can be learned jointly with other variational parameters.
  We argue theoretically that the resulting algorithm allows an intuitive trade-off
  between inference fidelity and computational cost. In an extensive empirical comparison
  we show that our method performs well in practice and that it is well-suited for
  black-box inference in probabilistic programming frameworks.
