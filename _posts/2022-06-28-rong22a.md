title: A Consistent and Efficient Evaluation Strategy for Attribution Methods
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'With a variety of local feature attribution methods being proposed in recent
  years, follow-up work suggested several evaluation strategies. To assess the attribution
  quality across different attribution techniques, the most popular among these evaluation
  strategies in the image domain use pixel perturbations. However, recent advances
  discovered that different evaluation strategies produce conflicting rankings of
  attribution methods and can be prohibitively expensive to compute. In this work,
  we present an information-theoretic analysis of evaluation strategies based on pixel
  perturbations. Our findings reveal that the results are strongly affected by information
  leakage through the shape of the removed pixels as opposed to their actual values.
  Using our theoretical insights, we propose a novel evaluation framework termed Remove
  and Debias (ROAD) which offers two contributions: First, it mitigates the impact
  of the confounders, which entails higher consistency among evaluation strategies.
  Second, ROAD does not require the computationally expensive retraining step and
  saves up to 99% in computational costs compared to the state-of-the-art. We release
  our source code at https://github.com/tleemann/road_evaluation.'
