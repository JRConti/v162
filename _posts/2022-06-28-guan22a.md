booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Deep learning has shown great potential for modeling the physical dynamics
  of complex particle systems such as fluids. Existing approaches, however, require
  the supervision of consecutive particle properties, including positions and velocities.
  In this paper, we consider a partially observable scenario known as fluid dynamics
  grounding, that is, inferring the state transitions and interactions within the
  fluid particle systems from sequential visual observations of the fluid surface.
  We propose a differentiable two-stage network named NeuroFluid. Our approach consists
  of (i) a particle-driven neural renderer, which involves fluid physical properties
  into the volume rendering function, and (ii) a particle transition model optimized
  to reduce the differences between the rendered and the observed images. NeuroFluid
  provides the first solution to unsupervised learning of particle-based fluid dynamics
  by training these two models jointly. It is shown to reasonably estimate the underlying
  physics of fluids with different initial shapes, viscosity, and densities.
