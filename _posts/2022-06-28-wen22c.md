title: Random Forest Density Estimation
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We propose a density estimation algorithm called <em>random forest density
  estimation</em> (<em>RFDE</em>) based on random trees where the split of cell is
  along the midpoint of the randomly chosen dimension. By combining the efficient
  random tree density estimation (RTDE) and the ensemble procedure, RFDE can alleviate
  the problems of boundary discontinuity suffered by partition-based density estimations.
  From the theoretical perspective, we first prove the fast convergence rates of RFDE
  if the density function lies in the HÃ¶lder space $C^{0,\alpha}$. Moreover, if the
  target function resides in the subspace $C^{1,\alpha}$, which contains smoother
  density functions, we for the first time manage to explain the benefits of the ensemble
  learning in density estimation. To be specific, we show that the upper bound of
  the ensemble estimator RFDE turns out to be strictly smaller than the lower bound
  of its base estimator RTDE in terms of convergence rates. In the experiments, we
  verify the theoretical results and show the promising performance of RFDE on both
  synthetic and real world datasets. Moreover, we evaluate our RFDE through the problem
  of anomaly detection as a possible application.
