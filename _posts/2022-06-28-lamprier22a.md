title: Generative Cooperative Networks for Natural Language Generation
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have known a tremendous success for
  many continuous generation tasks, especially in the field of image generation. However,
  for discrete outputs such as language, optimizing GANs remains an open problem with
  many instabilities, as no gradient can be properly back-propagated from the discriminator
  output to the generator parameters. An alternative is to learn the generator network
  via reinforcement learning, using the discriminator signal as a reward, but such
  a technique suffers from moving rewards and vanishing gradient problems. Finally,
  it often falls short compared to direct maximum-likelihood approaches. In this paper,
  we introduce Generative Cooperative Networks, in which the discriminator architecture
  is cooperatively used along with the generation policy to output samples of realistic
  texts for the task at hand. We give theoretical guarantees of convergence for our
  approach, and study various efficient decoding schemes to empirically achieve state-of-the-art
  results in two main NLG tasks.
