title: Uncertainty Modeling in Generative Compressed Sensing
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Compressed sensing (CS) aims to recover a high-dimensional signal with structural
  priors from its low-dimensional linear measurements. Inspired by the huge success
  of deep neural networks in modeling the priors of natural signals, generative neural
  networks have been recently used to replace the hand-crafted structural priors in
  CS. However, the reconstruction capability of the generative model is fundamentally
  limited by the range of its generator, typically a small subset of the signal space
  of interest. To break this bottleneck and thus reconstruct those out-of-range signals,
  this paper presents a novel method called CS-BGM that can effectively expands the
  range of generator. Specifically, CS-BGM introduces uncertainties to the latent
  variable and parameters of the generator, while adopting the variational inference
  (VI) and maximum a posteriori (MAP) to infer them. Theoretical analysis demonstrates
  that expanding the range of generators is necessary for reducing the reconstruction
  error in generative CS. Extensive experiments show a consistent improvement of CS-BGM
  over the baselines.
