title: A Branch and Bound Framework for Stronger Adversarial Attacks of ReLU Networks
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Strong adversarial attacks are important for evaluating the true robustness
  of deep neural networks. Most existing attacks search in the input space, e.g.,
  using gradient descent, and may miss adversarial examples due to non-convexity.
  In this work, we systematically search adversarial examples in the activation space
  of ReLU networks to tackle hard instances where none of the existing adversarial
  attacks succeed. Unfortunately, searching the activation space typically relies
  on generic mixed integer programming (MIP) solvers and is limited to small networks
  and easy problem instances. To improve scalability and practicability, we use branch
  and bound (BaB) with specialized GPU-based bound propagation methods, and propose
  a top-down beam-search approach to quickly identify the subspace that may contain
  adversarial examples. Moreover, we build an adversarial candidates pool using cheap
  attacks to further assist the search in activation space via diving techniques and
  a bottom-up large neighborhood search. Our adversarial attack framework, BaB-Attack,
  opens up a new opportunity for designing novel adversarial attacks not limited to
  searching the input space, and enables us to borrow techniques from integer programming
  theory and neural network verification. In experiments, we can successfully generate
  adversarial examples when existing attacks on input space fail. Compared to off-the-shelf
  MIP solver based attacks that requires significant computations, we outperform in
  both success rates and efficiency.
