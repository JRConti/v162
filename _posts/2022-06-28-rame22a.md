title: 'Fishr: Invariant Gradient Variances for Out-of-Distribution Generalization'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Learning robust models that generalize well under changes in the data distribution
  is critical for real-world applications. To this end, there has been a growing surge
  of interest to learn simultaneously from multiple training domains - while enforcing
  different types of invariance across those domains. Yet, all existing approaches
  fail to show systematic benefits under controlled evaluation protocols. In this
  paper, we introduce a new regularization - named Fishr - that enforces domain invariance
  in the space of the gradients of the loss: specifically, the domain-level variances
  of gradients are matched across training domains. Our approach is based on the close
  relations between the gradient covariance, the Fisher Information and the Hessian
  of the loss: in particular, we show that Fishr eventually aligns the domain-level
  loss landscapes locally around the final weights. Extensive experiments demonstrate
  the effectiveness of Fishr for out-of-distribution generalization. Notably, Fishr
  improves the state of the art on the DomainBed benchmark and performs consistently
  better than Empirical Risk Minimization. Our code is available at https://github.com/alexrame/fishr.'
