title: The CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Learning representations of algorithms is an emerging area of machine learning,
  seeking to bridge concepts from neural networks with classical algorithms. Several
  important works have investigated whether neural networks can effectively reason
  like algorithms, typically by learning to execute them. The common trend in the
  area, however, is to generate targeted kinds of algorithmic data to evaluate specific
  hypotheses, making results hard to transfer across publications, and increasing
  the barrier of entry. To consolidate progress and work towards unified evaluation,
  we propose the CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark, covering classical algorithms
  from the Introduction to Algorithms textbook. Our benchmark spans a variety of algorithmic
  reasoning procedures, including sorting, searching, dynamic programming, graph algorithms,
  string algorithms and geometric algorithms. We perform extensive experiments to
  demonstrate how several popular algorithmic reasoning baselines perform on these
  tasks, and consequently, highlight links to several open challenges. Our library
  is readily available at https://github.com/deepmind/clrs.
