title: Unaligned Supervision for Automatic Music Transcription in The Wild
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Multi-instrument Automatic Music Transcription (AMT), or the decoding of
  a musical recording into semantic musical content, is one of the holy grails of
  Music Information Retrieval. Current AMT approaches are restricted to piano and
  (some) guitar recordings, due to difficult data collection. In order to overcome
  data collection barriers, previous AMT approaches attempt to employ musical scores
  in the form of a digitized version of the same song or piece. The scores are typically
  aligned using audio features and strenuous human intervention to generate training
  labels. We introduce Note$_{EM}$, a method for simultaneously training a transcriber
  and aligning the scores to their corresponding performances, in a fully-automated
  process. Using this unaligned supervision scheme, complemented by pseudo-labels
  and pitch shift augmentation, our method enables training on in-the-wild recordings
  with unprecedented accuracy and instrumental variety. Using only synthetic data
  and unaligned supervision, we report SOTA note-level accuracy of the MAPS dataset,
  and large favorable margins on cross-dataset evaluations. We also demonstrate robustness
  and ease of use; we report comparable results when training on a small, easily obtainable,
  self-collected dataset, and we propose alternative labeling to the MusicNet dataset,
  which we show to be more accurate. Our project page is available at https://benadar293.github.io.
