  Data'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We propose Compressed Vertical Federated Learning (C-VFL) for communication-efficient
  training on vertically partitioned data. In C-VFL, a server and multiple parties
  collaboratively train a model on their respective features utilizing several local
  iterations and sharing compressed intermediate results periodically. Our work provides
  the first theoretical analysis of the effect message compression has on distributed
  training over vertically partitioned data. We prove convergence of non-convex objectives
  at a rate of $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{T}})$ when the compression error is bounded over
  the course of training. We provide specific requirements for convergence with common
  compression techniques, such as quantization and top-$k$ sparsification. Finally,
  we experimentally show compression can reduce communication by over $90%$ without
  a significant decrease in accuracy over VFL without compression.
