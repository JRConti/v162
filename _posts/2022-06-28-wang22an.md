title: Thompson Sampling for Robust Transfer in Multi-Task Bandits
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We study the problem of online multi-task learning where the tasks are performed
  within similar but not necessarily identical multi-armed bandit environments. In
  particular, we study how a learner can improve its overall performance across multiple
  related tasks through robust transfer of knowledge. While an upper confidence bound
  (UCB)-based algorithm has recently been shown to achieve nearly-optimal performance
  guarantees in a setting where all tasks are solved concurrently, it remains unclear
  whether Thompson sampling (TS) algorithms, which have superior empirical performance
  in general, share similar theoretical properties. In this work, we present a TS-type
  algorithm for a more general online multi-task learning protocol, which extends
  the concurrent setting. We provide its frequentist analysis and prove that it is
  also nearly-optimal using a novel concentration inequality for multi-task data aggregation
  at random stopping times. Finally, we evaluate the algorithm on synthetic data and
  show that the TS-type algorithm enjoys superior empirical performance in comparison
  with the UCB-based algorithm and a baseline algorithm that performs TS for each
  individual task without transfer.
