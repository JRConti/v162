title: Proximal Exploration for Model-guided Protein Sequence Design
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Designing protein sequences with a particular biological function is a long-lasting
  challenge for protein engineering. Recent advances in machine-learning-guided approaches
  focus on building a surrogate sequence-function model to reduce the burden of expensive
  in-lab experiments. In this paper, we study the exploration mechanism of model-guided
  sequence design. We leverage a natural property of protein fitness landscape that
  a concise set of mutations upon the wild-type sequence are usually sufficient to
  enhance the desired function. By utilizing this property, we propose Proximal Exploration
  (PEX) algorithm that prioritizes the evolutionary search for high-fitness mutants
  with low mutation counts. In addition, we develop a specialized model architecture,
  called Mutation Factorization Network (MuFacNet), to predict low-order mutational
  effects, which further improves the sample efficiency of model-guided evolution.
  In experiments, we extensively evaluate our method on a suite of in-silico protein
  sequence design tasks and demonstrate substantial improvement over baseline algorithms.
