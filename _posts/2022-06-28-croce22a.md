title: Evaluating the Adversarial Robustness of Adaptive Test-time Defenses
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Adaptive defenses, which optimize at test time, promise to improve adversarial
  robustness. We categorize such adaptive test-time defenses, explain their potential
  benefits and drawbacks, and evaluate a representative variety of the latest adaptive
  defenses for image classification. Unfortunately, none significantly improve upon
  static defenses when subjected to our careful case study evaluation. Some even weaken
  the underlying static model while simultaneously increasing inference computation.
  While these results are disappointing, we still believe that adaptive test-time
  defenses are a promising avenue of research and, as such, we provide recommendations
  for their thorough evaluation. We extend the checklist of Carlini et al. (2019)
  by providing concrete steps specific to adaptive defenses.
