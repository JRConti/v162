title: Stability Based Generalization Bounds for Exponential Family Langevin Dynamics
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Recent years have seen advances in generalization bounds for noisy stochastic
  algorithms, especially stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) based on stability
  (Mou et al., 2018; Li et al., 2020) and information theoretic approaches (Xu & Raginsky,
  2017; Negrea et al., 2019; Steinke & Zakynthinou, 2020). In this paper, we unify
  and substantially generalize stability based generalization bounds and make three
  technical contributions. First, we bound the generalization error in terms of expected
  (not uniform) stability which arguably leads to quantitatively sharper bounds. Second,
  as our main contribution, we introduce Exponential Family Langevin Dynamics (EFLD),
  a substantial generalization of SGLD, which includes noisy versions of Sign-SGD
  and quantized SGD as special cases. We establish data dependent expected stability
  based generalization bounds for any EFLD algorithm with a O(1/n) sample dependence
  and dependence on gradient discrepancy rather than the norm of gradients, yielding
  significantly sharper bounds. Third, we establish optimization guarantees for special
  cases of EFLD. Further, empirical results on benchmarks illustrate that our bounds
  are non-vacuous, quantitatively sharper than existing bounds, and behave correctly
  under noisy labels.
