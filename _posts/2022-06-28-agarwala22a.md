title: Deep equilibrium networks are sensitive to initialization statistics
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Deep equilibrium networks (DEQs) are a promising way to construct models
  which trade off memory for compute. However, theoretical understanding of these
  models is still lacking compared to traditional networks, in part because of the
  repeated application of a single set of weights. We show that DEQs are sensitive
  to the higher order statistics of the matrix families from which they are initialized.
  In particular, initializing with orthogonal or symmetric matrices allows for greater
  stability in training. This gives us a practical prescription for initializations
  which allow for training with a broader range of initial weight scales.
