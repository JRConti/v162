title: Planning with Diffusion for Flexible Behavior Synthesis
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning methods often use learning only for the
  purpose of recovering an approximate dynamics model, offloading the rest of the
  decision-making work to classical trajectory optimizers. While conceptually simple,
  this combination has a number of empirical shortcomings, suggesting that learned
  models may not be well-suited to standard trajectory optimization. In this paper,
  we consider what it would look like to fold as much of the trajectory optimization
  pipeline as possible into the modeling problem, such that sampling from the model
  and planning with it become nearly identical. The core of our technical approach
  lies in a diffusion probabilistic model that plans by iteratively denoising trajectories.
  We show how classifier-guided sampling and image inpainting can be reinterpreted
  as coherent planning strategies, explore the unusual and useful properties of diffusion-based
  planning methods, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in control
  settings that emphasize long-horizon decision-making and test-time flexibility.
