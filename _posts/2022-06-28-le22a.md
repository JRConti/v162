title: Entropic Gromov-Wasserstein between Gaussian Distributions
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We study the entropic Gromov-Wasserstein and its unbalanced version between
  (unbalanced) Gaussian distributions with different dimensions. When the metric is
  the inner product, which we refer to as inner product Gromov-Wasserstein (IGW),
  we demonstrate that the optimal transportation plans of entropic IGW and its unbalanced
  variant are (unbalanced) Gaussian distributions. Via an application of von Neumannâ€™s
  trace inequality, we obtain closed-form expressions for the entropic IGW between
  these Gaussian distributions. Finally, we consider an entropic inner product Gromov-Wasserstein
  barycenter of multiple Gaussian distributions. We prove that the barycenter is a
  Gaussian distribution when the entropic regularization parameter is small. We further
  derive a closed-form expression for the covariance matrix of the barycenter.
