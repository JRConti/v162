title: 'Style Equalization: Unsupervised Learning of Controllable Generative Sequence
  Models'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Controllable generative sequence models with the capability to extract and
  replicate the style of specific examples enable many applications, including narrating
  audiobooks in different voices, auto-completing and auto-correcting written handwriting,
  and generating missing training samples for downstream recognition tasks. However,
  under an unsupervised-style setting, typical training algorithms for controllable
  sequence generative models suffer from the training-inference mismatch, where the
  same sample is used as content and style input during training but unpaired samples
  are given during inference. In this paper, we tackle the training-inference mismatch
  encountered during unsupervised learning of controllable generative sequence models.
  The proposed method is simple yet effective, where we use a style transformation
  module to transfer target style information into an unrelated style input. This
  method enables training using unpaired content and style samples and thereby mitigate
  the training-inference mismatch. We apply style equalization to text-to-speech and
  text-to-handwriting synthesis on three datasets. We conduct thorough evaluation,
  including both quantitative and qualitative user studies. Our results show that
  by mitigating the training-inference mismatch with the proposed style equalization,
  we achieve style replication scores comparable to real data in our user studies.
