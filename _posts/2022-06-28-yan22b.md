title: Optimally Controllable Perceptual Lossy Compression
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: "Recent studies in lossy compression show that distortion and perceptual
  quality are at odds with each other, which put forward the tradeoff between distortion
  and perception (D-P). Intuitively, to attain different perceptual quality, different
  decoders have to be trained. In this paper, we present a nontrivial finding that
  only two decoders are sufficient for optimally achieving arbitrary (an infinite
  number of different) D-P tradeoff. We prove that arbitrary points of the D-P tradeoff
  bound can be achieved by a simple linear interpolation between the outputs of a
  minimum MSE decoder and a specifically constructed perfect perceptual decoder. Meanwhile,
  the perceptual quality (in terms of the squared Wasserstein-2 distance metric) can
  be quantitatively controlled by the interpolation factor. Furthermore, to construct
  a perfect perceptual decoder, we propose two theoretically optimal training frameworks.
  The new frameworks are different from the distortion-plus-adversarial loss based
  heuristic framework widely used in existing methods, which are not only theoretically
  optimal but also can yield state-of-the-art performance in practical perceptual
  decoding. Finally, we validate our theoretical finding and demonstrate the superiority
  of our frameworks via experiments. Code is available at: https://github.com/ZeyuYan/Controllable\x02Perceptual-Compression"
