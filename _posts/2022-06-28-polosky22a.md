title: Constrained Offline Policy Optimization
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In this work we introduce Constrained Offline Policy Optimization (COPO),
  an offline policy optimization algorithm for learning in MDPs with cost constraints.
  COPO is built upon a novel offline cost-projection method, which we formally derive
  and analyze. Our method improves upon the state-of-the-art in offline constrained
  policy optimization by explicitly accounting for distributional shift and by offering
  non-asymptotic confidence bounds on the cost of a policy. These formal properties
  are superior to those of existing techniques, which only guarantee convergence to
  a point estimate. We formally analyze our method and empirically demonstrate that
  it achieves state-of-the-art performance on discrete and continuous control problems,
  while offering the aforementioned improved, stronger, and more robust theoretical
  guarantees.
