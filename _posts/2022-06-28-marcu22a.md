title: On the Effects of Artificial Data Modification
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Data distortion is commonly applied in vision models during both training
  (e.g methods like MixUp and CutMix) and evaluation (e.g. shape-texture bias and
  robustness). This data modification can introduce artificial information. It is
  often assumed that the resulting artefacts are detrimental to training, whilst being
  negligible when analysing models. We investigate these assumptions and conclude
  that in some cases they are unfounded and lead to incorrect results. Specifically,
  we show current shape bias identification methods and occlusion robustness measures
  are biased and propose a fairer alternative for the latter. Subsequently, through
  a series of experiments we seek to correct and strengthen the communityâ€™s perception
  of how augmenting affects learning of vision models. Based on our empirical results
  we argue that the impact of the artefacts must be understood and exploited rather
  than eliminated.
