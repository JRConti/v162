title: Fast Finite Width Neural Tangent Kernel
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), defined as the outer product of the neural
  network (NN) Jacobians, has emerged as a central object of study in deep learning.
  In the infinite width limit, the NTK can sometimes be computed analytically and
  is useful for understanding training and generalization of NN architectures. At
  finite widths, the NTK is also used to better initialize NNs, compare the conditioning
  across models, perform architecture search, and do meta-learning. Unfortunately,
  the finite width NTK is notoriously expensive to compute, which severely limits
  its practical utility. We perform the first in-depth analysis of the compute and
  memory requirements for NTK computation in finite width networks. Leveraging the
  structure of neural networks, we further propose two novel algorithms that change
  the exponent of the compute and memory requirements of the finite width NTK, dramatically
  improving efficiency. Our algorithms can be applied in a black box fashion to any
  differentiable function, including those implementing neural networks. We open-source
  our implementations within the Neural Tangents package at https://github.com/google/neural-tangents.
