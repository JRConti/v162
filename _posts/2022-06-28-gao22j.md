title: Value Function based Difference-of-Convex Algorithm for Bilevel Hyperparameter
  Selection Problems
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Existing gradient-based optimization methods for hyperparameter tuning
  can only guarantee theoretical convergence to stationary solutions when the bilevel
  program satisfies the condition that for fixed upper-level variables, the lower-level
  is strongly convex (LLSC) and smooth (LLS). This condition is not satisfied for
  bilevel programs arising from tuning hyperparameters in many machine learning algorithms.
  In this work, we develop a sequentially convergent Value Function based Difference-of-Convex
  Algorithm with inexactness (VF-iDCA). We then ask: can this algorithm achieve stationary
  solutions without LLSC and LLS assumptions? We provide a positive answer to this
  question for bilevel programs from a broad class of hyperparameter tuning applications.
  Extensive experiments justify our theoretical results and demonstrate the superiority
  of the proposed VF-iDCA when applied to tune hyperparameters.'
