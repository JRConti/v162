title: 'Exploiting Redundancy: Separable Group Convolutional Networks on Lie Groups'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Group convolutional neural networks (G-CNNs) have been shown to increase
  parameter efficiency and model accuracy by incorporating geometric inductive biases.
  In this work, we investigate the properties of representations learned by regular
  G-CNNs, and show considerable parameter redundancy in group convolution kernels.
  This finding motivates further weight-tying by sharing convolution kernels over
  subgroups. To this end, we introduce convolution kernels that are separable over
  the subgroup and channel dimensions. In order to obtain equivariance to arbitrary
  affine Lie groups we provide a continuous parameterisation of separable convolution
  kernels. We evaluate our approach across several vision datasets, and show that
  our weight sharing leads to improved performance and computational efficiency. In
  many settings, separable G-CNNs outperform their non-separable counterpart, while
  only using a fraction of their training time. In addition, thanks to the increase
  in computational efficiency, we are able to implement G-CNNs equivariant to the
  $\mathrm{Sim(2)}$ group; the group of dilations, rotations and translations of the
  plane. $\mathrm{Sim(2)}$-equivariance further improves performance on all tasks
  considered, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on rotated MNIST.
