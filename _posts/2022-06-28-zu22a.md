title: 'SpaceMAP: Visualizing High-Dimensional Data by Space Expansion'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Dimensionality reduction (DR) of high-dimensional data is of theoretical
  and practical interest in machine learning. However, there exist intriguing, non-intuitive
  discrepancies between the geometry of high- and low-dimensional space. We look into
  such discrepancies and propose a novel visualization method called Space-based Manifold
  Approximation and Projection (SpaceMAP). Our method establishes an analytical transformation
  on distance metrics between spaces to address the â€œcrowding problem" in DR. With
  the proposed equivalent extended distance (EED), we are able to match the capacity
  of high- and low-dimensional space in a principled manner. To handle complex data
  with different manifold properties, we propose hierarchical manifold approximation
  to model the similarity function in a data-specific manner. We evaluated SpaceMAP
  on a range of synthetic and real datasets with varying manifold properties, and
  demonstrated its excellent performance in comparison with classical and state-of-the-art
  DR methods. In particular, the concept of space expansion provides a generic framework
  for understanding nonlinear DR methods including the popular t-distributed Stochastic
  Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection
