title: Structured Stochastic Gradient MCMC
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Stochastic gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (SGMCMC) is a scalable algorithm
  for asymptotically exact Bayesian inference in parameter-rich models, such as Bayesian
  neural networks. However, since mixing can be slow in high dimensions, practitioners
  often resort to variational inference (VI). Unfortunately, VI makes strong assumptions
  on both the factorization and functional form of the posterior. To relax these assumptions,
  this work proposes a new non-parametric variational inference scheme that combines
  ideas from both SGMCMC and coordinate-ascent VI. The approach relies on a new Langevin-type
  algorithm that operates on a "self-averaged" posterior energy function, where parts
  of the latent variables are averaged over samples from earlier iterations of the
  Markov chain. This way, statistical dependencies between coordinates can be broken
  in a controlled way, allowing the chain to mix faster. This scheme can be further
  modified in a "dropout" manner, leading to even more scalability. We test our scheme
  for ResNet-20 on CIFAR-10, SVHN, and FMNIST. In all cases, we find improvements
  in convergence speed and/or final accuracy compared to SGMCMC and parametric VI.
