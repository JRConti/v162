title: Instance Dependent Regret Analysis of Kernelized Bandits
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: "We study the problem of designing an adaptive strategy for querying a noisy
  zeroth-order-oracle to efficiently learn about the optimizer of an unknown function
  $f$. To make the problem tractable, we assume that $f$ lies in the reproducing kernel
  Hilbert space (RKHS) associated with a known kernel $K$, with its norm bounded by
  $M<\\infty$. Prior results, working in a <em>minimax framework</em>, have characterized
  the worst-case (over all functions in the problem class) limits on regret achievable
  by <em>any</em> algorithm, and have constructed algorithms with matching (modulo
  polylogarithmic factors) worst-case performance for the Matern family of kernels.
  \tThese results suffer from two drawbacks. First, the minimax lower bound gives
  limited information about the limits of regret achievable by commonly used algorithms
  on a specific problem instance $f$. Second, the existing upper bound analysis fails
  to adapt to easier problem instances within the function class. Our work takes steps
  to address both these issues. First, we derive <em>instance-dependent</em> regret
  lower bounds for algorithms with uniformly (over the function class) vanishing normalized
  cumulative regret. Our result, valid for several practically relevant kernelized
  bandits algorithms, such as, GP-UCB, GP-TS and SupKernelUCB, identifies a fundamental
  complexity measure associated with every problem instance. We then address the second
  issue, by proposing a new minimax near-optimal algorithm that also adapts to easier
  problem instances."
