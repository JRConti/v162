title: 'C*-algebra Net: A New Approach Generalizing Neural Network Parameters to C*-algebra'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We propose a new framework that generalizes the parameters of neural network
  models to $C^*$-algebra-valued ones. $C^*$-algebra is a generalization of the space
  of complex numbers. A typical example is the space of continuous functions on a
  compact space. This generalization enables us to combine multiple models continuously
  and use tools for functions such as regression and integration. Consequently, we
  can learn features of data efficiently and adapt the models to problems continuously.
  We apply our framework to practical problems such as density estimation and few-shot
  learning and show that our framework enables us to learn features of data even with
  a limited number of samples. Our new framework highlights the potential possibility
  of applying the theory of $C^*$-algebra to general neural network models.
