title: 'GenLabel: Mixup Relabeling using Generative Models'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Mixup is a data augmentation method that generates new data points by mixing
  a pair of input data. While mixup generally improves the prediction performance,
  it sometimes degrades the performance. In this paper, we first identify the main
  causes of this phenomenon by theoretically and empirically analyzing the mixup algorithm.
  To resolve this, we propose GenLabel, a simple yet effective relabeling algorithm
  designed for mixup. In particular, GenLabel helps the mixup algorithm correctly
  label mixup samples by learning the class-conditional data distribution using generative
  models. Via theoretical and empirical analysis, we show that mixup, when used together
  with GenLabel, can effectively resolve the aforementioned phenomenon, improving
  the accuracy of mixup-trained model.
