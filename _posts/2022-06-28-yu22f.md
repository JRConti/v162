  Neural Networks'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Neural networks tend to achieve better accuracy with training if they are
  larger {—} even if the resulting models are overparameterized. Nevertheless, carefully
  removing such excess of parameters before, during, or after training may also produce
  models with similar or even improved accuracy. In many cases, that can be curiously
  achieved by heuristics as simple as removing a percentage of the weights with the
  smallest absolute value {—} even though absolute value is not a perfect proxy for
  weight relevance. With the premise that obtaining significantly better performance
  from pruning depends on accounting for the combined effect of removing multiple
  weights, we revisit one of the classic approaches for impact-based pruning: the
  Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS). We propose a tractable heuristic for solving the combinatorial
  extension of OBS, in which we select weights for simultaneous removal, and we combine
  it with a single-pass systematic update of unpruned weights. Our selection method
  outperforms other methods for high sparsity, and the single-pass weight update is
  also advantageous if applied after those methods.'
