title: Learning Symmetric Embeddings for Equivariant World Models
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Incorporating symmetries can lead to highly data-efficient and generalizable
  models by defining equivalence classes of data samples related by transformations.
  However, characterizing how transformations act on input data is often difficult,
  limiting the applicability of equivariant models. We propose learning symmetric
  embedding networks (SENs) that encode an input space (e.g. images), where we do
  not know the effect of transformations (e.g. rotations), to a feature space that
  transforms in a known manner under these operations. This network can be trained
  end-to-end with an equivariant task network to learn an explicitly symmetric representation.
  We validate this approach in the context of equivariant transition models with 3
  distinct forms of symmetry. Our experiments demonstrate that SENs facilitate the
  application of equivariant networks to data with complex symmetry representations.
  Moreover, doing so can yield improvements in accuracy and generalization relative
  to both fully-equivariant and non-equivariant baselines.
