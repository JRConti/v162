title: Fast-Rate PAC-Bayesian Generalization Bounds for Meta-Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: PAC-Bayesian error bounds provide a theoretical guarantee on the generalization
  abilities of meta-learning from training tasks to unseen tasks. However, it is still
  unclear how tight PAC-Bayesian bounds we can achieve for meta-learning. In this
  work, we propose a general PAC-Bayesian framework to cope with single-task learning
  and meta-learning uniformly. With this framework, we generalize the two tightest
  PAC-Bayesian bounds (i.e., kl-bound and Catoni-bound) from single-task learning
  to standard meta-learning, resulting in fast convergence rates for PAC-Bayesian
  meta-learners. By minimizing the derived two bounds, we develop two meta-learning
  algorithms for classification problems with deep neural networks. For regression
  problems, by setting Gibbs optimal posterior for each training task, we obtain the
  closed-form formula of the minimizer of our Catoni-bound, leading to an efficient
  Gibbs meta-learning algorithm. Although minimizing our kl-bound can not yield a
  closed-form solution, we show that it can be extended for analyzing the more challenging
  meta-learning setting where samples from different training tasks exhibit interdependencies.
  Experiments empirically show that our proposed meta-learning algorithms achieve
  competitive results with respect to latest works.
