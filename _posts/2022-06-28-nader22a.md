title: 'DNNR: Differential Nearest Neighbors Regression'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'K-nearest neighbors (KNN) is one of the earliest and most established algorithms
  in machine learning. For regression tasks, KNN averages the targets within a neighborhood
  which poses a number of challenges: the neighborhood definition is crucial for the
  predictive performance as neighbors might be selected based on uninformative features,
  and averaging does not account for how the function changes locally. We propose
  a novel method called Differential Nearest Neighbors Regression (DNNR) that addresses
  both issues simultaneously: during training, DNNR estimates local gradients to scale
  the features; during inference, it performs an n-th order Taylor approximation using
  estimated gradients. In a large-scale evaluation on over 250 datasets, we find that
  DNNR performs comparably to state-of-the-art gradient boosting methods and MLPs
  while maintaining the simplicity and transparency of KNN. This allows us to derive
  theoretical error bounds and inspect failures. In times that call for transparency
  of ML models, DNNR provides a good balance between performance and interpretability.'
