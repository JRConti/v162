  Game Signatures'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Cheung and Piliouras (2020) recently showed that two variants of the Multiplicative
  Weights Update method - OMWU and MWU - display opposite convergence properties depending
  on whether the game is zero-sum or cooperative. Inspired by this work and the recent
  literature on learning to optimize for single functions, we introduce a new framework
  for learning last-iterate convergence to Nash Equilibria in games, where the update
  ruleâ€™s coefficients (learning rates) along a trajectory are learnt by a reinforcement
  learning policy that is conditioned on the nature of the game: <em>the game signature</em>.
  We construct the latter using a new decomposition of two-player games into eight
  components corresponding to commutative projection operators, generalizing and unifying
  recent game concepts studied in the literature. We compare the performance of various
  update rules when their coefficients are learnt, and show that the RL policy is
  able to exploit the game signature across a wide range of game types. In doing so,
  we introduce CMWU, a new algorithm that extends consensus optimization to the constrained
  case, has local convergence guarantees for zero-sum bimatrix games, and show that
  it enjoys competitive performance on both zero-sum games with constant coefficients
  and across a spectrum of games when its coefficients are learnt.'
