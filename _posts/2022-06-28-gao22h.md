title: Lazy Estimation of Variable Importance for Large Neural Networks
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: As opaque predictive models increasingly impact many areas of modern life,
  interest in quantifying the importance of a given input variable for making a specific
  prediction has grown. Recently, there has been a proliferation of model-agnostic
  methods to measure variable importance (VI) that analyze the difference in predictive
  power between a full model trained on all variables and a reduced model that excludes
  the variable(s) of interest. A bottleneck common to these methods is the estimation
  of the reduced model for each variable (or subset of variables), which is an expensive
  process that often does not come with theoretical guarantees. In this work, we propose
  a fast and flexible method for approximating the reduced model with important inferential
  guarantees. We replace the need for fully retraining a wide neural network by a
  linearization initialized at the full model parameters. By adding a ridge-like penalty
  to make the problem convex, we prove that when the ridge penalty parameter is sufficiently
  large, our method estimates the variable importance measure with an error rate of
  O(1/n) where n is the number of training samples. We also show that our estimator
  is asymptotically normal, enabling us to provide confidence bounds for the VI estimates.
  We demonstrate through simulations that our method is fast and accurate under several
  data-generating regimes, and we demonstrate its real-world applicability on a seasonal
  climate forecasting example.
