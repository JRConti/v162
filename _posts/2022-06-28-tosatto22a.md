title: A Temporal-Difference Approach to Policy Gradient Estimation
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The policy gradient theorem (Sutton et al., 2000) prescribes the usage of
  a cumulative discounted state distribution under the target policy to approximate
  the gradient. Most algorithms based on this theorem, in practice, break this assumption,
  introducing a distribution shift that can cause the convergence to poor solutions.
  In this paper, we propose a new approach of reconstructing the policy gradient from
  the start state without requiring a particular sampling strategy. The policy gradient
  calculation in this form can be simplified in terms of a gradient critic, which
  can be recursively estimated due to a new Bellman equation of gradients. By using
  temporal-difference updates of the gradient critic from an off-policy data stream,
  we develop the first estimator that side-steps the distribution shift issue in a
  model-free way. We prove that, under certain realizability conditions, our estimator
  is unbiased regardless of the sampling strategy. We empirically show that our technique
  achieves a superior bias-variance trade-off and performance in presence of off-policy
  samples.
