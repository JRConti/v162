title: Latent Outlier Exposure for Anomaly Detection with Contaminated Data
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Anomaly detection aims at identifying data points that show systematic
  deviations from the majority of data in an unlabeled dataset. A common assumption
  is that clean training data (free of anomalies) is available, which is often violated
  in practice. We propose a strategy for training an anomaly detector in the presence
  of unlabeled anomalies that is compatible with a broad class of models. The idea
  is to jointly infer binary labels to each datum (normal vs. anomalous) while updating
  the model parameters. Inspired by outlier exposure (Hendrycks et al., 2018) that
  considers synthetically created, labeled anomalies, we thereby use a combination
  of two losses that share parameters: one for the normal and one for the anomalous
  data. We then iteratively proceed with block coordinate updates on the parameters
  and the most likely (latent) labels. Our experiments with several backbone models
  on three image datasets, 30 tabular data sets, and a video anomaly detection benchmark
  showed consistent and significant improvements over the baselines.'
