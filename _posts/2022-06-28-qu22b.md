title: Particle Transformer for Jet Tagging
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Jet tagging is a critical yet challenging classification task in particle
  physics. While deep learning has transformed jet tagging and significantly improved
  performance, the lack of a large-scale public dataset impedes further enhancement.
  In this work, we present JetClass, a new comprehensive dataset for jet tagging.
  The JetClass dataset consists of 100 M jets, about two orders of magnitude larger
  than existing public datasets. A total of 10 types of jets are simulated, including
  several types unexplored for tagging so far. Based on the large dataset, we propose
  a new Transformer-based architecture for jet tagging, called Particle Transformer
  (ParT). By incorporating pairwise particle interactions in the attention mechanism,
  ParT achieves higher tagging performance than a plain Transformer and surpasses
  the previous state-of-the-art, ParticleNet, by a large margin. The pre-trained ParT
  models, once fine-tuned, also substantially enhance the performance on two widely
  adopted jet tagging benchmarks. The dataset, code and models are publicly available
  at https://github.com/jet-universe/particle_transformer.
