title: Revisiting End-to-End Speech-to-Text Translation From Scratch
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: End-to-end (E2E) speech-to-text translation (ST) often depends on pretraining
  its encoder and/or decoder using source transcripts via speech recognition or text
  translation tasks, without which translation performance drops substantially. However,
  transcripts are not always available, and how significant such pretraining is for
  E2E ST has rarely been studied in the literature. In this paper, we revisit this
  question and explore the extent to which the quality of E2E ST trained on speech-translation
  pairs alone can be improved. We reexamine several techniques proven beneficial to
  ST previously, and offer a set of best practices that biases a Transformer-based
  E2E ST system toward training from scratch. Besides, we propose parameterized distance
  penalty to facilitate the modeling of locality in the self-attention model for speech.
  On four benchmarks covering 23 languages, our experiments show that, without using
  any transcripts or pretraining, the proposed system reaches and even outperforms
  previous studies adopting pretraining, although the gap remains in (extremely) low-resource
  settings. Finally, we discuss neural acoustic feature modeling, where a neural model
  is designed to extract acoustic features from raw speech signals directly, with
  the goal to simplify inductive biases and add freedom to the model in describing
  speech. For the first time, we demonstrate its feasibility and show encouraging
  results on ST tasks.
