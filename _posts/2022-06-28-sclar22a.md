title: Symmetric Machine Theory of Mind
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Theory of mind, the ability to model others’ thoughts and desires, is a
  cornerstone of human social intelligence. This makes it an important challenge for
  the machine learning community, but previous works mainly attempt to design agents
  that model the "mental state" of others as passive observers or in specific predefined
  roles, such as in speaker-listener scenarios. In contrast, we propose to model machine
  theory of mind in a more general symmetric scenario. We introduce a multi-agent
  environment SymmToM where, like in real life, all agents can speak, listen, see
  other agents, and move freely through the world. Effective strategies to maximize
  an agent’s reward require it to develop a theory of mind. We show that reinforcement
  learning agents that model the mental states of others achieve significant performance
  improvements over agents with no such theory of mind model. Importantly, our best
  agents still fail to achieve performance comparable to agents with access to the
  gold-standard mental state of other agents, demonstrating that the modeling of theory
  of mind in multi-agent scenarios is very much an open challenge.
