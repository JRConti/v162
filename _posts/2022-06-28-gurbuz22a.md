title: 'NISPA: Neuro-Inspired Stability-Plasticity Adaptation for Continual Learning
  in Sparse Networks'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The goal of continual learning (CL) is to learn different tasks over time.
  The main desiderata associated with CL are to maintain performance on older tasks,
  leverage the latter to improve learning of future tasks, and to introduce minimal
  overhead in the training process (for instance, to not require a growing model or
  retraining). We propose the Neuro-Inspired Stability-Plasticity Adaptation (NISPA)
  architecture that addresses these desiderata through a sparse neural network with
  fixed density. NISPA forms stable paths to preserve learned knowledge from older
  tasks. Also, NISPA uses connection rewiring to create new plastic paths that reuse
  existing knowledge on novel tasks. Our extensive evaluation on EMNIST, FashionMNIST,
  CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 datasets shows that NISPA significantly outperforms representative
  state-of-the-art continual learning baselines, and it uses up to ten times fewer
  learnable parameters compared to baselines. We also make the case that sparsity
  is an essential ingredient for continual learning. The NISPA code is available at
