title: Distribution Regression with Sliced Wasserstein Kernels
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The problem of learning functions over spaces of probabilities - or distribution
  regression - is gaining significant interest in the machine learning community.
  The main challenge in these settings is to identify a suitable representation capturing
  all relevant properties of a distribution. The well-established approach in this
  sense is to use kernel mean embeddings, which lift kernel-induced similarity on
  the input domain at the probability level. This strategy effectively tackles the
  two-stage sampling nature of the problem, enabling one to derive estimators with
  strong statistical guarantees, such as universal consistency and excess risk bounds.
  However, kernel mean embeddings implicitly hinge on the maximum mean discrepancy
  (MMD), a metric on probabilities, which is not the most suited to capture geometrical
  relations between distributions. In contrast, optimal transport (OT) metrics, are
  potentially more appealing. In this work, we propose an OT-based estimator for distribution
  regression. We build on the Sliced Wasserstein distance to obtain an OT-based representation.
  We study the theoretical properties of a kernel ridge regression estimator based
  on such representation, for which we prove universal consistency and excess risk
  bounds. Preliminary experiments complement our theoretical findings by showing the
  effectiveness of the proposed approach and compare it with MMD-based estimators.
