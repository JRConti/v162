title: Generative Flow Networks for Discrete Probabilistic Modeling
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We present energy-based generative flow networks (EB-GFN), a novel probabilistic
  modeling algorithm for high-dimensional discrete data. Building upon the theory
  of generative flow networks (GFlowNets), we model the generation process by a stochastic
  data construction policy and thus amortize expensive MCMC exploration into a fixed
  number of actions sampled from a GFlowNet. We show how GFlowNets can approximately
  perform large-block Gibbs sampling to mix between modes. We propose a framework
  to jointly train a GFlowNet with an energy function, so that the GFlowNet learns
  to sample from the energy distribution, while the energy learns with an approximate
  MLE objective with negative samples from the GFlowNet. We demonstrate EB-GFNâ€™s effectiveness
  on various probabilistic modeling tasks. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/zdhNarsil/EB_GFN.
