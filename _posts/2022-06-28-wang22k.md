title: The Geometry of Robust Value Functions
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The space of value functions is a fundamental concept in reinforcement learning.
  Characterizing its geometric properties may provide insights for optimization and
  representation. Existing works mainly focus on the value space for Markov Decision
  Processes (MDPs). In this paper, we study the geometry of the robust value space
  for the more general Robust MDPs (RMDPs) setting, where transition uncertainties
  are considered. Specifically, since we find it hard to directly adapt prior approaches
  to RMDPs, we start with revisiting the non-robust case, and introduce a new perspective
  that enables us to characterize both the non-robust and robust value space in a
  similar fashion. The key of this perspective is to decompose the value space, in
  a state-wise manner, into unions of hypersurfaces. Through our analysis, we show
  that the robust value space is determined by a set of conic hypersurfaces, each
  of which contains the robust values of all policies that agree on one state. Furthermore,
  we find that taking only extreme points in the uncertainty set is sufficient to
  determine the robust value space. Finally, we discuss some other aspects about the
  robust value space, including its non-convexity and policy agreement on multiple
  states.
