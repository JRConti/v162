title: 'Understanding Clipping for Federated Learning: Convergence and Client-Level
  Differential Privacy'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Providing privacy protection has been one of the primary motivations of
  Federated Learning (FL). Recently, there has been a line of work on incorporating
  the formal privacy notion of differential privacy with FL. To guarantee the client-level
  differential privacy in FL algorithms, the clients’ transmitted model updates have
  to be clipped before adding privacy noise. Such clipping operation is substantially
  different from its counterpart of gradient clipping in the centralized differentially
  private SGD and has not been well-understood. In this paper, we first empirically
  demonstrate that the clipped FedAvg can perform surprisingly well even with substantial
  data heterogeneity when training neural networks, which is partly because the clients’
  updates become similar for several popular deep architectures. Based on this key
  observation, we provide the convergence analysis of a differential private (DP)
  FedAvg algorithm and highlight the relationship between clipping bias and the distribution
  of the clients’ updates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that
  rigorously investigates theoretical and empirical issues regarding the clipping
  operation in FL algorithms.
