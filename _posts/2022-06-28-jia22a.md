title: Improving Policy Optimization with Generalist-Specialist Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Generalization in deep reinforcement learning over unseen environment variations
  usually requires policy learning over a large set of diverse training variations.
  We empirically observe that an agent trained on many variations (a generalist) tends
  to learn faster at the beginning, yet its performance plateaus at a less optimal
  level for a long time. In contrast, an agent trained only on a few variations (a
  specialist) can often achieve high returns under a limited computational budget.
  To have the best of both worlds, we propose a novel generalist-specialist training
  framework. Specifically, we first train a generalist on all environment variations;
  when it fails to improve, we launch a large population of specialists with weights
  cloned from the generalist, each trained to master a selected small subset of variations.
  We finally resume the training of the generalist with auxiliary rewards induced
  by demonstrations of all specialists. In particular, we investigate the timing to
  start specialist training and compare strategies to learn generalists with assistance
  from specialists. We show that this framework pushes the envelope of policy learning
  on several challenging and popular benchmarks including Procgen, Meta-World and
  ManiSkill.
