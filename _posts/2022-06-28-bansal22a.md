title: Certified Neural Network Watermarks with Randomized Smoothing
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Watermarking is a commonly used strategy to protect creators’ rights to
  digital images, videos and audio. Recently, watermarking methods have been extended
  to deep learning models – in principle, the watermark should be preserved when an
  adversary tries to copy the model. However, in practice, watermarks can often be
  removed by an intelligent adversary. Several papers have proposed watermarking methods
  that claim to be empirically resistant to different types of removal attacks, but
  these new techniques often fail in the face of new or better-tuned adversaries.
  In this paper, we propose the first <em>certifiable</em> watermarking method. Using
  the randomized smoothing technique, we show that our watermark is guaranteed to
  be unremovable unless the model parameters are changed by more than a certain $\ell_2$
  threshold. In addition to being certifiable, our watermark is also empirically more
  robust compared to previous watermarking methods.
