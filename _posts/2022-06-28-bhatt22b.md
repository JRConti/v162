title: Nearly Optimal Catoni’s M-estimator for Infinite Variance
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In this paper, we extend the remarkable M-estimator of Catoni \citep{Cat12}
  to situations where the variance is infinite. In particular, given a sequence of
  i.i.d random variables $\{X_i\}_{i=1}^n$ from distribution $\mathcal{D}$ over $\mathbb{R}$
  with mean $\mu$, we only assume the existence of a known upper bound $\upsilon_{\varepsilon}
  > 0$ on the $(1+\varepsilon)^{th}$ central moment of the random variables, namely,
  for $\varepsilon \in (0,1]$ \[ \mathbb{E}_{X_1 \sim \mathcal{D}} \Big| X_1 - \mu
  \Big|^{1+\varepsilon} \leq \upsilon_{\varepsilon}. \]{The} extension is non-trivial
  owing to the difficulty in characterizing the roots of certain polynomials of degree
  smaller than $2$. The proposed estimator has the same order of magnitude and the
  same asymptotic constant as in \citet{Cat12}, but for the case of bounded moments.
  We further propose a version of the estimator that does not require even the knowledge
  of $\upsilon_{\varepsilon}$, but adapts the moment bound in a data-driven manner.
  Finally, to illustrate the usefulness of the derived non-asymptotic confidence bounds,
  we consider an application in multi-armed bandits and propose best arm identification
  algorithms, in the fixed confidence setting, that outperform the state of the art.
