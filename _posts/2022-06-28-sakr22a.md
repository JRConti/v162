title: Optimal Clipping and Magnitude-aware Differentiation for Improved Quantization-aware
  Training
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Data clipping is crucial in reducing noise in quantization operations and
  improving the achievable accuracy of quantization-aware training (QAT). Current
  practices rely on heuristics to set clipping threshold scalars and cannot be shown
  to be optimal. We propose Optimally Clipped Tensors And Vectors (OCTAV), a recursive
  algorithm to determine MSE-optimal clipping scalars. Derived from the fast Newton-Raphson
  method, OCTAV finds optimal clipping scalars on the fly, for every tensor, at every
  iteration of the QAT routine. Thus, the QAT algorithm is formulated with provably
  minimum quantization noise at each step. In addition, we reveal limitations in common
  gradient estimation techniques in QAT and propose magnitude-aware differentiation
  as a remedy to further improve accuracy. Experimentally, OCTAV-enabled QAT achieves
  state-of-the-art accuracy on multiple tasks. These include training-from-scratch
  and retraining ResNets and MobileNets on ImageNet, and Squad fine-tuning using BERT
  models, where OCTAV-enabled QAT consistently preserves accuracy at low precision
  (4-to-6-bits). Our results require no modifications to the baseline training recipe,
  except for the insertion of quantization operations where appropriate.
