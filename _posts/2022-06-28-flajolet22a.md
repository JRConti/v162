title: Fast Population-Based Reinforcement Learning on a Single Machine
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Training populations of agents has demonstrated great promise in Reinforcement
  Learning for stabilizing training, improving exploration and asymptotic performance,
  and generating a diverse set of solutions. However, population-based training is
  often not considered by practitioners as it is perceived to be either prohibitively
  slow (when implemented sequentially), or computationally expensive (if agents are
  trained in parallel on independent accelerators). In this work, we compare implementations
  and revisit previous studies to show that the judicious use of compilation and vectorization
  allows population-based training to be performed on a single machine with one accelerator
  with minimal overhead compared to training a single agent. We also show that, when
  provided with a few accelerators, our protocols extend to large population sizes
  for applications such as hyperparameter tuning. We hope that this work and the public
  release of our code will encourage practitioners to use population-based learning
  techniques more frequently for their research and applications.
