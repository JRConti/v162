title: Variational Mixtures of ODEs for Inferring Cellular Gene Expression Dynamics
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: A key problem in computational biology is discovering the gene expression
  changes that regulate cell fate transitions, in which one cell type turns into another.
  However, each individual cell cannot be tracked longitudinally, and cells at the
  same point in real time may be at different stages of the transition process. This
  can be viewed as a problem of learning the behavior of a dynamical system from observations
  whose times are unknown. Additionally, a single progenitor cell type often bifurcates
  into multiple child cell types, further complicating the problem of modeling the
  dynamics. To address this problem, we developed an approach called variational mixtures
  of ordinary differential equations. By using a simple family of ODEs informed by
  the biochemistry of gene expression to constrain the likelihood of a deep generative
  model, we can simultaneously infer the latent time and latent state of each cell
  and predict its future gene expression state. The model can be interpreted as a
  mixture of ODEs whose parameters vary continuously across a latent space of cell
  states. Our approach dramatically improves data fit, latent time inference, and
  future cell state estimation of single-cell gene expression data compared to previous
  approaches.
