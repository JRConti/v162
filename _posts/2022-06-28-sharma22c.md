booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In this paper, we consider nonconvex minimax optimization, which is gaining
  prominence in many modern machine learning applications, such as GANs. Large-scale
  edge-based collection of training data in these applications calls for communication-efficient
  distributed optimization algorithms, such as those used in federated learning, to
  process the data. In this paper, we analyze local stochastic gradient descent ascent
  (SGDA), the local-update version of the SGDA algorithm. SGDA is the core algorithm
  used in minimax optimization, but it is not well-understood in a distributed setting.
  We prove that Local SGDA has <em>order-optimal</em> sample complexity for several
  classes of nonconvex-concave and nonconvex-nonconcave minimax problems, and also
  enjoys <em>linear speedup</em> with respect to the number of clients. We provide
  a novel and tighter analysis, which improves the convergence and communication guarantees
  in the existing literature. For nonconvex-PL and nonconvex-one-point-concave functions,
  we improve the existing complexity results for centralized minimax problems. Furthermore,
  we propose a momentum-based local-update algorithm, which has the same convergence
  guarantees, but outperforms Local SGDA as demonstrated in our experiments.
