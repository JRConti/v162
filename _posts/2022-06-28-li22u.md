title: Generalization Guarantee of Training Graph Convolutional Networks with Graph
  Topology Sampling
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have recently achieved great empirical
  success in learning graph-structured data. To address its scalability issue due
  to the recursive embedding of neighboring features, graph topology sampling has
  been proposed to reduce the memory and computational cost of training GCNs, and
  it has achieved comparable test performance to those without topology sampling in
  many empirical studies. To the best of our knowledge, this paper provides the first
  theoretical justification of graph topology sampling in training (up to) three-layer
  GCNs for semi-supervised node classification. We formally characterize some sufficient
  conditions on graph topology sampling such that GCN training leads to diminishing
  generalization error. Moreover, our method tackles the non-convex interaction of
  weights across layers, which is under-explored in the existing theoretical analyses
  of GCNs. This paper characterizes the impact of graph structures and topology sampling
  on the generalization performance and sample complexity explicitly, and the theoretical
  findings are also justified through numerical experiments.
