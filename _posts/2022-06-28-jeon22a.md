title: 'MASER: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Subgoals Generated from Experience
  Replay Buffer'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'In this paper, we consider cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning
  (MARL) with sparse reward. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel method named
  MASER: MARL with subgoals generated from experience replay buffer. Under the widely-used
  assumption of centralized training with decentralized execution and consistent Q-value
  decomposition for MARL, MASER automatically generates proper subgoals for multiple
  agents from the experience replay buffer by considering both individual Q-value
  and total Q-value. Then, MASER designs individual intrinsic reward for each agent
  based on actionable representation relevant to Q-learning so that the agents reach
  their subgoals while maximizing the joint action value. Numerical results show that
  MASER significantly outperforms StarCraft II micromanagement benchmark compared
  to other state-of-the-art MARL algorithms.'
