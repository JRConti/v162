title: Maximum Likelihood Training for Score-based Diffusion ODEs by High Order Denoising
  Score Matching
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Score-based generative models have excellent performance in terms of generation
  quality and likelihood. They model the data distribution by matching a parameterized
  score network with first-order data score functions. The score network can be used
  to define an ODE (“score-based diffusion ODE”) for exact likelihood evaluation.
  However, the relationship between the likelihood of the ODE and the score matching
  objective is unclear. In this work, we prove that matching the first-order score
  is not sufficient to maximize the likelihood of the ODE, by showing a gap between
  the maximum likelihood and score matching objectives. To fill up this gap, we show
  that the negative likelihood of the ODE can be bounded by controlling the first,
  second, and third-order score matching errors; and we further present a novel high-order
  denoising score matching method to enable maximum likelihood training of score-based
  diffusion ODEs. Our algorithm guarantees that the higher-order matching error is
  bounded by the training error and the lower-order errors. We empirically observe
  that by high-order score matching, score-based diffusion ODEs achieve better likelihood
  on both synthetic data and CIFAR-10, while retaining the high generation quality.
