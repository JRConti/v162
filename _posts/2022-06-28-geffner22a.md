title: Variational Inference with Locally Enhanced Bounds for Hierarchical Models
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Hierarchical models represent a challenging setting for inference algorithms.
  MCMC methods struggle to scale to large models with many local variables and observations,
  and variational inference (VI) may fail to provide accurate approximations due to
  the use of simple variational families. Some variational methods (e.g. importance
  weighted VI) integrate Monte Carlo methods to give better accuracy, but these tend
  to be unsuitable for hierarchical models, as they do not allow for subsampling and
  their performance tends to degrade for high dimensional models. We propose a new
  family of variational bounds for hierarchical models, based on the application of
  tightening methods (e.g. importance weighting) separately for each group of local
  random variables. We show that our approach naturally allows the use of subsampling
  to get unbiased gradients, and that it fully leverages the power of methods that
  build tighter lower bounds by applying them independently in lower dimensional spaces,
  leading to better results and more accurate posterior approximations than relevant
  baselines.
