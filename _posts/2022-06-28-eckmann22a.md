title: 'LIMO: Latent Inceptionism for Targeted Molecule Generation'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Generation of drug-like molecules with high binding affinity to target proteins
  remains a difficult and resource-intensive task in drug discovery. Existing approaches
  primarily employ reinforcement learning, Markov sampling, or deep generative models
  guided by Gaussian processes, which can be prohibitively slow when generating molecules
  with high binding affinity calculated by computationally-expensive physics-based
  methods. We present Latent Inceptionism on Molecules (LIMO), which significantly
  accelerates molecule generation with an inceptionism-like technique. LIMO employs
  a variational autoencoder-generated latent space and property prediction by two
  neural networks in sequence to enable faster gradient-based reverse-optimization
  of molecular properties. Comprehensive experiments show that LIMO performs competitively
  on benchmark tasks and markedly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on the novel
  task of generating drug-like compounds with high binding affinity, reaching nanomolar
  range against two protein targets. We corroborate these docking-based results with
  more accurate molecular dynamics-based calculations of absolute binding free energy
  and show that one of our generated drug-like compounds has a predicted $K_D$ (a
  measure of binding affinity) of $6 \cdot 10^{-14}$ M against the human estrogen
  receptor, well beyond the affinities of typical early-stage drug candidates and
  most FDA-approved drugs to their respective targets. Code is available at https://github.com/Rose-STL-Lab/LIMO.
