title: Robust Models Are More Interpretable Because Attributions Look Normal
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Recent work has found that adversarially-robust deep networks used for
  image classification are more interpretable: their feature attributions tend to
  be sharper, and are more concentrated on the objects associated with the image’s
  ground- truth class. We show that smooth decision boundaries play an important role
  in this enhanced interpretability, as the model’s input gradients around data points
  will more closely align with boundaries’ normal vectors when they are smooth. Thus,
  because robust models have smoother boundaries, the results of gradient- based attribution
  methods, like Integrated Gradients and DeepLift, will capture more accurate information
  about nearby decision boundaries. This understanding of robust interpretability
  leads to our second contribution: boundary attributions, which aggregate information
  about the normal vectors of local decision bound- aries to explain a classification
  outcome. We show that by leveraging the key fac- tors underpinning robust interpretability,
  boundary attributions produce sharper, more concentrated visual explanations{—}even
  on non-robust models.'
