title: Choosing Answers in Epsilon-Best-Answer Identification for Linear Bandits
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: "In pure-exploration problems, information is gathered sequentially to answer
  a question on the stochastic environment. While best-arm identification for linear
  bandits has been extensively studied in recent years, few works have been dedicated
  to identifying one arm that is $\\varepsilon$-close to the best one (and not exactly
  the best one). In this problem with several correct answers, an identification algorithm
  should focus on one candidate among those answers and verify that it is correct.
  We demonstrate that picking the answer with highest mean does not allow an algorithm
  to reach asymptotic optimality in terms of expected sample complexity. Instead,
  a <em>furthest answer</em> should be identified.\t\t Using that insight to choose
  the candidate answer carefully, we develop a simple procedure to adapt best-arm
  identification algorithms to tackle $\\varepsilon$-best-answer identification in
  transductive linear stochastic bandits. Finally, we propose an asymptotically optimal
  algorithm for this setting, which is shown to achieve competitive empirical performance
  against existing modified best-arm identification algorithms."
