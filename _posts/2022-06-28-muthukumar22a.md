title: Universal and data-adaptive algorithms for model selection in linear contextual
  bandits
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Model selection in contextual bandits is an important complementary problem
  to regret minimization with respect to a fixed model class. We consider the simplest
  non-trivial instance of model-selection: distinguishing a simple multi-armed bandit
  problem from a linear contextual bandit problem. Even in this instance, current
  state-of-the-art methods explore in a suboptimal manner and require strong "feature-diversity"
  conditions. In this paper, we introduce new algorithms that a) explore in a data-adaptive
  manner, and b) provide model selection guarantees of the form O(d^{\alpha} T^{1
  - \alpha}) with no feature diversity conditions whatsoever, where d denotes the
  dimension of the linear model and T denotes the total number of rounds. The first
  algorithm enjoys a "best-of-both-worlds" property, recovering two prior results
  that hold under distinct distributional assumptions, simultaneously. The second
  removes distributional assumptions altogether, expanding the scope for tractable
  model selection. Our approach extends to model selection among nested linear contextual
  bandits under some additional assumptions.'
