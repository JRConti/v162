title: A Hierarchical Transitive-Aligned Graph Kernel for Un-attributed Graphs
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In this paper, we develop a new graph kernel, namely the Hierarchical Transitive-Aligned
  Kernel, by transitively aligning the vertices between graphs through a family of
  hierarchical prototype graphs. Comparing to most existing state-of-the-art graph
  kernels, the proposed kernel has three theoretical advantages. First, it incorporates
  the locational correspondence information between graphs into the kernel computation,
  and thus overcomes the shortcoming of ignoring structural correspondences arising
  in most R-convolution kernels. Second, it guarantees the transitivity between the
  correspondence information that is not available for most existing matching kernels.
  Third, it incorporates the information of all graphs under comparisons into the
  kernel computation process, and thus encapsulates richer characteristics. Experimental
  evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the new transitive-aligned kernel.
