title: On the Difficulty of Defending Self-Supervised Learning against Model Extraction
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) is an increasingly popular ML paradigm that
  trains models to transform complex inputs into representations without relying on
  explicit labels. These representations encode similarity structures that enable
  efficient learning of multiple downstream tasks. Recently, ML-as-a-Service providers
  have commenced offering trained SSL models over inference APIs, which transform
  user inputs into useful representations for a fee. However, the high cost involved
  to train these models and their exposure over APIs both make black-box extraction
  a realistic security threat. We thus explore model stealing attacks against SSL.
  Unlike traditional model extraction on classifiers that output labels, the victim
  models here output representations; these representations are of significantly higher
  dimensionality compared to the low-dimensional prediction scores output by classifiers.
  We construct several novel attacks and find that approaches that train directly
  on a victimâ€™s stolen representations are query efficient and enable high accuracy
  for downstream models. We then show that existing defenses against model extraction
  are inadequate and not easily retrofitted to the specificities of SSL.
