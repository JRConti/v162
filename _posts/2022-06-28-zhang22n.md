title: Dynamic Topic Models for Temporal Document Networks
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Dynamic topic models explore the time evolution of topics in temporally
  accumulative corpora. While existing topic models focus on the dynamics of individual
  documents, we propose two neural topic models aimed at learning unified topic distributions
  that incorporate both document dynamics and network structure. For the first model,
  by adding a time dimension, we propose Time-Aware Optimal Transport, which measures
  the probability of a link between two differently timestamped documents using their
  semantic distance. Since the gradually evolving topological structure of network
  may also influence the establishment of a new link, for the second model, we further
  design a Temporal Point Process to capture the impact of historical neighbors on
  the current link formation at the network level. Experiments on four dynamic document
  networks demonstrate the advantage of our models in jointly modeling document dynamics
  and network adjacency.
