title: On the Convergence of the Shapley Value in Parametric Bayesian Learning Games
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Measuring contributions is a classical problem in cooperative game theory
  where the Shapley value is the most well-known solution concept. In this paper,
  we establish the convergence property of the Shapley value in parametric Bayesian
  learning games where players perform a Bayesian inference using their combined data,
  and the posterior-prior KL divergence is used as the characteristic function. We
  show that for any two players, under some regularity conditions, their difference
  in Shapley value converges in probability to the difference in Shapley value of
  a limiting game whose characteristic function is proportional to the log-determinant
  of the joint Fisher information. As an application, we present an online collaborative
  learning framework that is asymptotically Shapley-fair. Our result enables this
  to be achieved without any costly computations of posterior-prior KL divergences.
  Only a consistent estimator of the Fisher information is needed. The effectiveness
  of our framework is demonstrated with experiments using real-world data.
