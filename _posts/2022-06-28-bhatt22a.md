title: Minimax M-estimation under Adversarial Contamination
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We present a new finite-sample analysis of Catoni’s M-estimator under adversarial
  contamination, where an adversary is allowed to corrupt a fraction of the samples
  arbitrarily. We make minimal assumptions on the distribution of the uncontaminated
  random variables, namely, we only assume the existence of a known upper bound $\upsilon_{\varepsilon}
  > 0$ on the $(1+\varepsilon)^{th}$ central moment of the random variables, namely,
  for $\varepsilon \in (0,1]$ \[ \mathbb{E}_{X_1 \sim \mathcal{D}} \Big| X_1 - \mu
  \Big|^{1+\varepsilon} \leq \upsilon_{\varepsilon}. \]{We} provide a lower bound
  on the minimax error rate for the mean estimation problem under adversarial corruption
  under this weak assumption, and establish that the proposed M-estimator achieves
  this lower bound (up to multiplicative constants). When the variance is infinite,
  the tolerance to contamination of any estimator reduces as $\varepsilon \downarrow
  0$. We establish a tight upper bound that characterizes this bargain. To illustrate
  the usefulness of the derived robust M-estimator in an online setting, we present
  a bandit algorithm for the partially identifiable best arm identification problem
  that improves upon the sample complexity of the state of the art algorithms.
