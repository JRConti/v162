title: 'FedNew: A Communication-Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Newton-Type Method
  for Federated Learning'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Newton-type methods are popular in federated learning due to their fast
  convergence. Still, they suffer from two main issues, namely: low communication
  efficiency and low privacy due to the requirement of sending Hessian information
  from clients to parameter server (PS). In this work, we introduced a novel framework
  called FedNew in which there is no need to transmit Hessian information from clients
  to PS, hence resolving the bottleneck to improve communication efficiency. In addition,
  FedNew hides the gradient information and results in a privacy-preserving approach
  compared to the existing state-of-the-art. The core novel idea in FedNew is to introduce
  a two level framework, and alternate between updating the inverse Hessian-gradient
  product using only one alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) step and
  then performing the global model update using Newtonâ€™s method. Though only one ADMM
  pass is used to approximate the inverse Hessian-gradient product at each iteration,
  we develop a novel theoretical approach to show the converging behavior of FedNew
  for convex problems. Additionally, a significant reduction in communication overhead
  is achieved by utilizing stochastic quantization. Numerical results using real datasets
  show the superiority of FedNew compared to existing methods in terms of communication
  costs.'
