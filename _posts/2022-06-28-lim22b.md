title: Order Constraints in Optimal Transport
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Optimal transport is a framework for comparing measures whereby a cost is
  incurred for transporting one measure to another. Recent works have aimed to improve
  optimal transport plans through the introduction of various forms of structure.
  We introduce novel order constraints into the optimal transport formulation to allow
  for the incorporation of structure. We define an efficient method for obtaining
  explainable solutions to the new formulation that scales far better than standard
  approaches. The theoretical properties of the method are provided. We demonstrate
  experimentally that order constraints improve explainability using the e-SNLI (Stanford
  Natural Language Inference) dataset that includes human-annotated rationales as
  well as on several image color transfer examples.
