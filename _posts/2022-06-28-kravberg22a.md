title: Active Nearest Neighbor Regression Through Delaunay Refinement
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We introduce an algorithm for active function approximation based on nearest
  neighbor regression. Our Active Nearest Neighbor Regressor (ANNR) relies on the
  Voronoi-Delaunay framework from computational geometry to subdivide the space into
  cells with constant estimated function value and select novel query points in a
  way that takes the geometry of the function graph into account. We consider the
  recent state-of-the-art active function approximator called DEFER, which is based
  on incremental rectangular partitioning of the space, as the main baseline. The
  ANNR addresses a number of limitations that arise from the space subdivision strategy
  used in DEFER. We provide a computationally efficient implementation of our method,
  as well as theoretical halting guarantees. Empirical results show that ANNR outperforms
  the baseline for both closed-form functions and real-world examples, such as gravitational
  wave parameter inference and exploration of the latent space of a generative model.
