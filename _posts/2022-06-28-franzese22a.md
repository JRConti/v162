title: Revisiting the Effects of Stochasticity for Hamiltonian Samplers
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'We revisit the theoretical properties of Hamiltonian stochastic differential
  equations (SDES) for Bayesian posterior sampling, and we study the two types of
  errors that arise from numerical SDE simulation: the discretization error and the
  error due to noisy gradient estimates in the context of data subsampling. Our main
  result is a novel analysis for the effect of mini-batches through the lens of differential
  operator splitting, revising previous literature results. The stochastic component
  of a Hamiltonian SDE is decoupled from the gradient noise, for which we make no
  normality assumptions. This leads to the identification of a convergence bottleneck:
  when considering mini-batches, the best achievable error rate is $\mathcal{O}(\eta^2)$,
  with $\eta$ being the integrator step size. Our theoretical results are supported
  by an empirical study on a variety of regression and classification tasks for Bayesian
  neural networks.'
