title: Label-Free Explainability for Unsupervised Models
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Unsupervised black-box models are challenging to interpret. Indeed, most
  existing explainability methods require labels to select which component(s) of the
  black-box’s output to interpret. In the absence of labels, black-box outputs often
  are representation vectors whose components do not correspond to any meaningful
  quantity. Hence, choosing which component(s) to interpret in a label-free unsupervised/self-supervised
  setting is an important, yet unsolved problem. To bridge this gap in the literature,
  we introduce two crucial extensions of post-hoc explanation techniques: (1) label-free
  feature importance and (2) label-free example importance that respectively highlight
  influential features and training examples for a black-box to construct representations
  at inference time. We demonstrate that our extensions can be successfully implemented
  as simple wrappers around many existing feature and example importance methods.
  We illustrate the utility of our label-free explainability paradigm through a qualitative
  and quantitative comparison of representation spaces learned by various autoencoders
  trained on distinct unsupervised tasks.'
