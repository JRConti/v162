title: Certified Robustness Against Natural Language Attacks by Causal Intervention
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Deep learning models have achieved great success in many fields, yet they
  are vulnerable to adversarial examples. This paper follows a causal perspective
  to look into the adversarial vulnerability and proposes Causal Intervention by Semantic
  Smoothing (CISS), a novel framework towards robustness against natural language
  attacks. Instead of merely fitting observational data, CISS learns causal effects
  p(y|do(x)) by smoothing in the latent semantic space to make robust predictions,
  which scales to deep architectures and avoids tedious construction of noise customized
  for specific attacks. CISS is provably robust against word substitution attacks,
  as well as empirically robust even when perturbations are strengthened by unknown
  attack algorithms. For example, on YELP, CISS surpasses the runner-up by 6.8% in
  terms of certified robustness against word substitutions, and achieves 80.7% empirical
  robustness when syntactic attacks are integrated.
