title: A Theoretical Analysis on Independence-driven Importance Weighting for Covariate-shift
  Generalization
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Covariate-shift generalization, a typical case in out-of-distribution (OOD)
  generalization, requires a good performance on the unknown test distribution, which
  varies from the accessible training distribution in the form of covariate shift.
  Recently, independence-driven importance weighting algorithms in stable learning
  literature have shown empirical effectiveness to deal with covariate-shift generalization
  on several learning models, including regression algorithms and deep neural networks,
  while their theoretical analyses are missing. In this paper, we theoretically prove
  the effectiveness of such algorithms by explaining them as feature selection processes.
  We first specify a set of variables, named minimal stable variable set, that is
  the minimal and optimal set of variables to deal with covariate-shift generalization
  for common loss functions, such as the mean squared loss and binary cross-entropy
  loss. Afterward, we prove that under ideal conditions, independence-driven importance
  weighting algorithms could identify the variables in this set. Analysis of asymptotic
  properties is also provided. These theories are further validated in several synthetic
  experiments.
