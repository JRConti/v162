title: Partial and Asymmetric Contrastive Learning for Out-of-Distribution Detection
  in Long-Tailed Recognition
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Existing out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods are typically benchmarked
  on training sets with balanced class distributions. However, in real-world applications,
  it is common for the training sets to have long-tailed distributions. In this work,
  we first demonstrate that existing OOD detection methods commonly suffer from significant
  performance degradation when the training set is long-tail distributed. Through
  analysis, we posit that this is because the models struggle to distinguish the minority
  tail-class in-distribution samples, from the true OOD samples, making the tail classes
  more prone to be falsely detected as OOD. To solve this problem, we propose Partial
  and Asymmetric Supervised Contrastive Learning (PASCL), which explicitly encourages
  the model to distinguish between tail-class in-distribution samples and OOD samples.
  To further boost in-distribution classification accuracy, we propose Auxiliary Branch
  Finetuning, which uses two separate branches of BN and classification layers for
  anomaly detection and in-distribution classification, respectively. The intuition
  is that in-distribution and OOD anomaly data have different underlying distributions.
  Our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art method by $1.29%$, $1.45%$, $0.69%$
  anomaly detection false positive rate (FPR) and $3.24%$, $4.06%$, $7.89%$ in-distribution
  classification accuracy on CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and ImageNet-LT, respectively.
