title: Dataset Condensation with Contrastive Signals
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that gradient matching-based dataset synthesis,
  or dataset condensation (DC), methods can achieve state-of-theart performance when
  applied to data-efficient learning tasks. However, in this study, we prove that
  the existing DC methods can perform worse than the random selection method when
  taskirrelevant information forms a significant part of the training dataset. We
  attribute this to the lack of participation of the contrastive signals between the
  classes resulting from the class-wise gradient matching strategy. To address this
  problem, we propose Dataset Condensation with Contrastive signals (DCC) by modifying
  the loss function to enable the DC methods to effectively capture the differences
  between classes. In addition, we analyze the new loss function in terms of training
  dynamics by tracking the kernel velocity. Furthermore, we introduce a bi-level warm-up
  strategy to stabilize the optimization. Our experimental results indicate that while
  the existing methods are ineffective for fine-grained image classification tasks,
  the proposed method can successfully generate informative synthetic datasets for
  the same tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the
  baselines even on benchmark datasets such as SVHN, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100. Finally,
  we demonstrate the high applicability of the proposed method by applying it to continual
  learning tasks.
