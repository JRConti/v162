title: Fat–Tailed Variational Inference with Anisotropic Tail Adaptive Flows
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'While fat-tailed densities commonly arise as posterior and marginal distributions
  in robust models and scale mixtures, they present a problematic scenario when Gaussian-based
  variational inference fails to accurately capture tail decay. We first improve previous
  theory on tails of Lipschitz flows by quantifying how they affect the rate of tail
  decay and expanding the theory to non-Lipschitz polynomial flows. Next, we develop
  an alternative theory for multivariate tail parameters which is sensitive to tail-anisotropy.
  In doing so, we unveil a fundamental problem which plagues many existing flow-based
  methods: they can only model tail-isotropic distributions (i.e., distributions having
  the same tail parameter in every direction). To mitigate this and enable modeling
  of tail-anisotropic targets, we propose anisotropic tail-adaptive flows (ATAF).
  Experimental results confirm ATAF on both synthetic and real-world targets is competitive
  with prior work while also exhibiting appropriate tail-anisotropy.'
