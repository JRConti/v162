title: Detecting Adversarial Examples Is (Nearly) As Hard As Classifying Them
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Making classifiers robust to adversarial examples is challenging. Thus,
  many works tackle the seemingly easier task of <em>detecting</em> perturbed inputs.
  We show a barrier towards this goal. We prove a <em>hardness reduction</em> between
  detection and classification of adversarial examples: given a robust detector for
  attacks at distance $\epsilon$ (in some metric), we show how to build a similarly
  robust (but inefficient) <em>classifier</em> for attacks at distance $\epsilon/2$.
  Our reduction is <em>computationally</em> inefficient, but preserves the <em>data
  complexity</em> of the original detector. The reduction thus cannot be directly
  used to build practical classifiers. Instead, it is a useful sanity check to test
  whether empirical detection results imply something much stronger than the authors
  presumably anticipated (namely a highly robust and data-efficient <em>classifier</em>).
  To illustrate, we revisit $14$ empirical detector defenses published over the past
  years. For $12/14$ defenses, we show that the claimed detection results imply an
  inefficient classifier with robustness far beyond the state-of-the-art— thus casting
  some doubts on the results’ validity. Finally, we show that our reduction applies
  in both directions: a robust classifier for attacks at distance $\epsilon/2$ implies
  an inefficient robust detector at distance $\epsilon$. Thus, we argue that robust
  classification and robust detection should be regarded as (near)-equivalent problems,
  if we disregard their <em>computational</em> complexity.'
