title: Flow-based Recurrent Belief State Learning for POMDPs
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) provides a principled
  and generic framework to model real world sequential decision making processes but
  yet remains unsolved, especially for high dimensional continuous space and unknown
  models. The main challenge lies in how to accurately obtain the belief state, which
  is the probability distribution over the unobservable environment states given historical
  information. Accurately calculating this belief state is a precondition for obtaining
  an optimal policy of POMDPs. Recent advances in deep learning techniques show great
  potential to learn good belief states. However, existing methods can only learn
  approximated distribution with limited flexibility. In this paper, we introduce
  the \textbf{F}l\textbf{O}w-based \textbf{R}ecurrent \textbf{BE}lief \textbf{S}tate
  model (FORBES), which incorporates normalizing flows into the variational inference
  to learn general continuous belief states for POMDPs. Furthermore, we show that
  the learned belief states can be plugged into downstream RL algorithms to improve
  performance. In experiments, we show that our methods successfully capture the complex
  belief states that enable multi-modal predictions as well as high quality reconstructions,
  and results on challenging visual-motor control tasks show that our method achieves
  superior performance and sample efficiency.
