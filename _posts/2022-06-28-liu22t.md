title: 'Asking for Knowledge (AFK): Training RL Agents to Query External Knowledge
  Using Language'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'To solve difficult tasks, humans ask questions to acquire knowledge from
  external sources. In contrast, classical reinforcement learning agents lack such
  an ability and often resort to exploratory behavior. This is exacerbated as few
  present-day environments support querying for knowledge. In order to study how agents
  can be taught to query external knowledge via language, we first introduce two new
  environments: the grid-world-based Q-BabyAI and the text-based Q-TextWorld. In addition
  to physical interactions, an agent can query an external knowledge source specialized
  for these environments to gather information. Second, we propose the ‘Asking for
  Knowledge’ (AFK) agent, which learns to generate language commands to query for
  meaningful knowledge that helps solve the tasks. AFK leverages a non-parametric
  memory, a pointer mechanism and an episodic exploration bonus to tackle (1) irrelevant
  information, (2) a large query language space, (3) delayed reward for making meaningful
  queries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the AFK agent outperforms recent
  baselines on the challenging Q-BabyAI and Q-TextWorld environments.'
