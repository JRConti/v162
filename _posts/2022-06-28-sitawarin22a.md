title: Demystifying the Adversarial Robustness of Random Transformation Defenses
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Neural networks’ lack of robustness against attacks raises concerns in security-sensitive
  settings such as autonomous vehicles. While many countermeasures may look promising,
  only a few withstand rigorous evaluation. Defenses using random transformations
  (RT) have shown impressive results, particularly BaRT (Raff et al., 2019) on ImageNet.
  However, this type of defense has not been rigorously evaluated, leaving its robustness
  properties poorly understood. Their stochastic properties make evaluation more challenging
  and render many proposed attacks on deterministic models inapplicable. First, we
  show that the BPDA attack (Athalye et al., 2018a) used in BaRT’s evaluation is ineffective
  and likely overestimates its robustness. We then attempt to construct the strongest
  possible RT defense through the informed selection of transformations and Bayesian
  optimization for tuning their parameters. Furthermore, we create the strongest possible
  attack to evaluate our RT defense. Our new attack vastly outperforms the baseline,
  reducing the accuracy by 83% compared to the 19% reduction by the commonly used
  EoT attack ($4.3\times$ improvement). Our result indicates that the RT defense on
  the Imagenette dataset (a ten-class subset of ImageNet) is not robust against adversarial
  examples. Extending the study further, we use our new attack to adversarially train
  RT defense (called AdvRT), resulting in a large robustness gain. Code is available
