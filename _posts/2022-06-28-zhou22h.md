title: Probabilistic Bilevel Coreset Selection
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The goal of coreset selection in supervised learning is to produce a weighted
  subset of data, so that training only on the subset achieves similar performance
  as training on the entire dataset. Existing methods achieved promising results in
  resource-constrained scenarios such as continual learning and streaming. However,
  most of the existing algorithms are limited to traditional machine learning models.
  A few algorithms that can handle large models adopt greedy search approaches due
  to the difficulty in solving the discrete subset selection problem, which is computationally
  costly when coreset becomes larger and often produces suboptimal results. In this
  work, for the first time we propose a continuous probabilistic bilevel formulation
  of coreset selection by learning a probablistic weight for each training sample.
  The overall objective is posed as a bilevel optimization problem, where 1) the inner
  loop samples coresets and train the model to convergence and 2) the outer loop updates
  the sample probability progressively according to the modelâ€™s performance. Importantly,
  we develop an efficient solver to the bilevel optimization problem via unbiased
  policy gradient without trouble of implicit differentiation. We theoretically prove
  the convergence of this training procedure and demonstrate the superiority of our
  algorithm against various coreset selection methods in various tasks, especially
  in more challenging label-noise and class-imbalance scenarios.
