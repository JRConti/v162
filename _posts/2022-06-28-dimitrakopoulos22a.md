title: Variational Feature Pyramid Networks
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Recent architectures for object detection adopt a Feature Pyramid Network
  as a backbone for deep feature extraction. Many works focus on the design of pyramid
  networks which produce richer feature representations. In this work, we opt to learn
  a dataset-specific architecture for Feature Pyramid Networks. With the proposed
  method, the network fuses features at multiple scales, it is efficient in terms
  of parameters and operations, and yields better results across a variety of tasks
  and datasets. Starting by a complex network, we adopt Variational Inference to prune
  redundant connections. Our model, integrated with standard detectors, outperforms
  the state-of-the-art feature fusion networks.
