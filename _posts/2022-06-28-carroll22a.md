title: Estimating and Penalizing Induced Preference Shifts in Recommender Systems
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'The content that a recommender system (RS) shows to users influences them.
  Therefore, when choosing a recommender to deploy, one is implicitly also choosing
  to induce specific internal states in users. Even more, systems trained via long-horizon
  optimization will have direct incentives to manipulate users, e.g. shift their preferences
  so they are easier to satisfy. We focus on induced preference shifts in users. We
  argue that {–} before deployment {–} system designers should: estimate the shifts
  a recommender would induce; evaluate whether such shifts would be undesirable; and
  perhaps even actively optimize to avoid problematic shifts. These steps involve
  two challenging ingredients: estimation requires anticipating how hypothetical policies
  would influence user preferences if deployed {–} we do this by using historical
  user interaction data to train a predictive user model which implicitly contains
  their preference dynamics; evaluation and optimization additionally require metrics
  to assess whether such influences are manipulative or otherwise unwanted {–} we
  use the notion of "safe shifts", that define a trust region within which behavior
  is safe: for instance, the natural way in which users would shift without interference
  from the system could be deemed "safe". In simulated experiments, we show that our
  learned preference dynamics model is effective in estimating user preferences and
  how they would respond to new recommenders. Additionally, we show that recommenders
  that optimize for staying in the trust region can avoid manipulative behaviors while
  still generating engagement.'
