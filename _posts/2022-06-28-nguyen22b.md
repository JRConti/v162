abstract: Neural Processes (NPs) are a popular class of approaches for meta-learning.
  Similar to Gaussian Processes (GPs), NPs define distributions over functions and
  can estimate uncertainty in their predictions. However, unlike GPs, NPs and their
  variants suffer from underfitting and often have intractable likelihoods, which
  limit their applications in sequential decision making. We propose Transformer Neural
  Processes (TNPs), a new member of the NP family that casts uncertainty-aware meta
  learning as a sequence modeling problem. We learn TNPs via an autoregressive likelihood-based
  objective and instantiate it with a novel transformer-based architecture that respects
  the inductive biases inherent to the problem structure, such as invariance to the
  observed data points and equivariance to the unobserved points. We further design
  knobs within the TNP architecture to tradeoff the increase in expressivity of the
  decoding distribution with extra computation. Empirically, we show that TNPs achieve
  state-of-the-art performance on various benchmark problems, outperforming all previous
  NP variants on meta regression, image completion, contextual multi-armed bandits,
  and Bayesian optimization.
