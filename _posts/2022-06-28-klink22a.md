title: Curriculum Reinforcement Learning via Constrained Optimal Transport
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Curriculum reinforcement learning (CRL) allows solving complex tasks by
  generating a tailored sequence of learning tasks, starting from easy ones and subsequently
  increasing their difficulty. Although the potential of curricula in RL has been
  clearly shown in a variety of works, it is less clear how to generate them for a
  given learning environment, resulting in a variety of methods aiming to automate
  this task. In this work, we focus on the idea of framing curricula as interpolations
  between task distributions, which has previously been shown to be a viable approach
  to CRL. Identifying key issues of existing methods, we frame the generation of a
  curriculum as a constrained optimal transport problem between task distributions.
  Benchmarks show that this way of curriculum generation can improve upon existing
  CRL methods, yielding high performance in a variety of tasks with different characteristics.
