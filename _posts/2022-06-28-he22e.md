title: A Reduction from Linear Contextual Bandit Lower Bounds to Estimation Lower
  Bounds
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Linear contextual bandits and their variants are usually solved using algorithms
  guided by parameter estimation. Cauchy-Schwartz inequality established that estimation
  errors dominate algorithm regrets, and thus, accurate estimators suffice to guarantee
  algorithms with low regrets. In this paper, we complete the reverse direction by
  establishing the necessity. In particular, we provide a generic transformation from
  algorithms for linear contextual bandits to estimators for linear models, and show
  that algorithm regrets dominate estimation errors of their induced estimators, i.e.,
  low-regret algorithms must imply accurate estimators. Moreover, our analysis reduces
  the regret lower bound to an estimation error, bridging the lower bound analysis
  in linear contextual bandit problems and linear regression.
