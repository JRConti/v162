title: Difference Advantage Estimation for Multi-Agent Policy Gradients
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Multi-agent policy gradient methods in centralized training with decentralized
  execution recently witnessed many progresses. During centralized training, multi-agent
  credit assignment is crucial, which can substantially promote learning performance.
  However, explicit multi-agent credit assignment in multi-agent policy gradient methods
  still receives less attention. In this paper, we investigate multi-agent credit
  assignment induced by reward shaping and provide a theoretical understanding in
  terms of its credit assignment and policy bias. Based on this, we propose an exponentially
  weighted advantage estimator, which is analogous to GAE, to enable multi-agent credit
  assignment while allowing the tradeoff with policy bias. Empirical results show
  that our approach can successfully perform effective multi-agent credit assignment,
  and thus substantially outperforms other advantage estimators.
