title: Adversarial Robustness against Multiple and Single $l_p$-Threat Models via
  Quick Fine-Tuning of Robust Classifiers
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: A major drawback of adversarially robust models, in particular for large
  scale datasets like ImageNet, is the extremely long training time compared to standard
  models. Moreover, models should be robust not only to one $l_p$-threat model but
  ideally to all of them. In this paper we propose Extreme norm Adversarial Training
  (E-AT) for multiple-norm robustness which is based on geometric properties of $l_p$-balls.
  E-AT costs up to three times less than other adversarial training methods for multiple-norm
  robustness. Using E-AT we show that for ImageNet a single epoch and for CIFAR-10
  three epochs are sufficient to turn any $l_p$-robust model into a multiple-norm
  robust model. In this way we get the first multiple-norm robust model for ImageNet
  and boost the state-of-the-art for multiple-norm robustness to more than $51%$ on
  CIFAR-10. Finally, we study the general transfer via fine-tuning of adversarial
  robustness between different individual $l_p$-threat models and improve the previous
  SOTA $l_1$-robustness on both CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. Extensive experiments show
  that our scheme works across datasets and architectures including vision transformers.
