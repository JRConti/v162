title: Model-Value Inconsistency as a Signal for Epistemic Uncertainty
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Using a model of the environment and a value function, an agent can construct
  many estimates of a state’s value, by unrolling the model for different lengths
  and bootstrapping with its value function. Our key insight is that one can treat
  this set of value estimates as a type of ensemble, which we call an implicit value
  ensemble (IVE). Consequently, the discrepancy between these estimates can be used
  as a proxy for the agent’s epistemic uncertainty; we term this signal model-value
  inconsistency or self-inconsistency for short. Unlike prior work which estimates
  uncertainty by training an ensemble of many models and/or value functions, this
  approach requires only the single model and value function which are already being
  learned in most model-based reinforcement learning algorithms. We provide empirical
  evidence in both tabular and function approximation settings from pixels that self-inconsistency
  is useful (i) as a signal for exploration, (ii) for acting safely under distribution
  shifts, and (iii) for robustifying value-based planning with a learned model.
