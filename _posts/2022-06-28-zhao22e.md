title: Learning from Counterfactual Links for Link Prediction
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Learning to predict missing links is important for many graph-based applications.
  Existing methods were designed to learn the association between observed graph structure
  and existence of link between a pair of nodes. However, the causal relationship
  between the two variables was largely ignored for learning to predict links on a
  graph. In this work, we visit this factor by asking a counterfactual question: "would
  the link still exist if the graph structure became different from observation?"
  Its answer, counterfactual links, will be able to augment the graph data for representation
  learning. To create these links, we employ causal models that consider the information
  (i.e., learned representations) of node pairs as context, global graph structural
  properties as treatment, and link existence as outcome. We propose a novel data
  augmentation-based link prediction method that creates counterfactual links and
  learns representations from both the observed and counterfactual links. Experiments
  on benchmark data show that our graph learning method achieves state-of-the-art
  performance on the task of link prediction.'
