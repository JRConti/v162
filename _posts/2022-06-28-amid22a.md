title: Public Data-Assisted Mirror Descent for Private Model Training
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In this paper, we revisit the problem of using in-distribution public data
  to improve the privacy/utility trade-offs for differentially private (DP) model
  training. (Here, public data refers to auxiliary data sets that have no privacy
  concerns.) We design a natural variant of DP mirror descent, where the DP gradients
  of the private/sensitive data act as the linear term, and the loss generated by
  the public data as the mirror map. We show that, for linear regression with feature
  vectors drawn from a non-isotropic sub-Gaussian distribution, our algorithm, PDA-DPMD
  (a variant of mirror descent), provides population risk guarantees that are asymptotically
  better than the best known guarantees under DP (without having access to public
  data), when the number of public data samples is sufficiently large. We further
  show that our algorithm has natural “noise stability” properties that control the
  variance due to noise added to ensure DP. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm
  by showing privacy/utility trade-offs on four benchmark datasets (StackOverflow,
  WikiText-2, CIFAR-10, and EMNIST). We show that our algorithm not only significantly
  improves over traditional DP-SGD, which does not have access to public data, but
  to our knowledge is the first to improve over DP-SGD on models that have been pre-trained
  with public data.
