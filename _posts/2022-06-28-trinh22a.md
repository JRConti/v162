title: Tackling covariate shift with node-based Bayesian neural networks
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) promise improved generalization under covariate
  shift by providing principled probabilistic representations of epistemic uncertainty.
  However, weight-based BNNs often struggle with high computational complexity of
  large-scale architectures and datasets. Node-based BNNs have recently been introduced
  as scalable alternatives, which induce epistemic uncertainty by multiplying each
  hidden node with latent random variables, while learning a point-estimate of the
  weights. In this paper, we interpret these latent noise variables as implicit representations
  of simple and domain-agnostic data perturbations during training, producing BNNs
  that perform well under covariate shift due to input corruptions. We observe that
  the diversity of the implicit corruptions depends on the entropy of the latent variables,
  and propose a straightforward approach to increase the entropy of these variables
  during training. We evaluate the method on out-of-distribution image classification
  benchmarks, and show improved uncertainty estimation of node-based BNNs under covariate
  shift due to input perturbations. As a side effect, the method also provides robustness
  against noisy training labels.
