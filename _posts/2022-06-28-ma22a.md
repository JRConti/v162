title: Versatile Offline Imitation from Observations and Examples via Regularized
  State-Occupancy Matching
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'We propose State Matching Offline DIstribution Correction Estimation (SMODICE),
  a novel and versatile regression-based offline imitation learning algorithm derived
  via state-occupancy matching. We show that the SMODICE objective admits a simple
  optimization procedure through an application of Fenchel duality and an analytic
  solution in tabular MDPs. Without requiring access to expert actions, SMODICE can
  be effectively applied to three offline IL settings: (i) imitation from observations
  (IfO), (ii) IfO with dynamics or morphologically mismatched expert, and (iii) example-based
  reinforcement learning, which we show can be formulated as a state-occupancy matching
  problem. We extensively evaluate SMODICE on both gridworld environments as well
  as on high-dimensional offline benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that SMODICE
  is effective for all three problem settings and significantly outperforms prior
  state-of-art.'
