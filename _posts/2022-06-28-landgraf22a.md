title: 'PINs: Progressive Implicit Networks for Multi-Scale Neural Representations'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) have proven to be effective scene encoders
  when combined with higher-dimensional projections of the input, commonly referred
  to as positional encoding. However, scenes with a wide frequency spectrum remain
  a challenge: choosing high frequencies for positional encoding introduces noise
  in low structure areas, while low frequencies results in poor fitting of detailed
  regions. To address this, we propose a progressive positional encoding, exposing
  a hierarchical MLP structure to incremental sets of frequency encodings. Our model
  accurately reconstructs scenes with wide frequency bands and learns a scene representation
  at progressive level of detail without explicit per-level supervision. The architecture
  is modular: each level encodes a continuous implicit representation that can be
  leveraged separately for its respective resolution, meaning a smaller network for
  coarser reconstructions. Experiments on several 2D and 3D datasets shows improvements
  in reconstruction accuracy, representational capacity and training speed compared
  to baselines.'
