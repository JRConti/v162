title: Locally Sparse Neural Networks for Tabular Biomedical Data
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Tabular datasets with low-sample-size or many variables are prevalent in
  biomedicine. Practitioners in this domain prefer linear or tree-based models over
  neural networks since the latter are harder to interpret and tend to overfit when
  applied to tabular datasets. To address these neural networksâ€™ shortcomings, we
  propose an intrinsically interpretable network for heterogeneous biomedical data.
  We design a locally sparse neural network where the local sparsity is learned to
  identify the subset of most relevant features for each sample. This sample-specific
  sparsity is predicted via a gating network, which is trained in tandem with the
  prediction network. By forcing the model to select a subset of the most informative
  features for each sample, we reduce model overfitting in low-sample-size data and
  obtain an interpretable model. We demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art
  models when applied to synthetic or real-world biomedical datasets using extensive
  experiments. Furthermore, the proposed framework dramatically outperforms existing
  schemes when evaluating its interpretability capabilities. Finally, we demonstrate
  the applicability of our model to two important biomedical tasks: survival analysis
  and marker gene identification.'
