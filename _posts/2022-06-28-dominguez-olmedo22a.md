title: On the Adversarial Robustness of Causal Algorithmic Recourse
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Algorithmic recourse seeks to provide actionable recommendations for individuals
  to overcome unfavorable classification outcomes from automated decision-making systems.
  Recourse recommendations should ideally be robust to reasonably small uncertainty
  in the features of the individual seeking recourse. In this work, we formulate the
  adversarially robust recourse problem and show that recourse methods that offer
  minimally costly recourse fail to be robust. We then present methods for generating
  adversarially robust recourse for linear and for differentiable classifiers. Finally,
  we show that regularizing the decision-making classifier to behave locally linearly
  and to rely more strongly on actionable features facilitates the existence of adversarially
  robust recourse.
