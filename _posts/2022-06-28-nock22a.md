booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'While Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) achieve spectacular results
  on unstructured data like images, there is still a gap on <em>tabular data</em>,
  data for which state of the art <em>supervised learning</em> still favours decision
  tree (DT)-based models. This paper proposes a new path forward for the generation
  of tabular data, exploiting decades-old understanding of the supervised task’s best
  components for DT induction, from losses (properness), models (tree-based) to algorithms
  (boosting). The <em>properness</em> condition on the supervised loss – which postulates
  the optimality of Bayes rule – leads us to a variational GAN-style loss formulation
  which is <em>tight</em> when discriminators meet a calibration property trivially
  satisfied by DTs, and, under common assumptions about the supervised loss, yields
  "one loss to train against them all" for the generator: the $\chi^2$. We then introduce
  tree-based generative models, <em>generative trees</em> (GTs), meant to mirror on
  the generative side the good properties of DTs for classifying tabular data, with
  a boosting-compliant <em>adversarial</em> training algorithm for GTs. We also introduce
  <em>copycat training</em>, in which the generator copies at run time the underlying
  tree (graph) of the discriminator DT and completes it for the hardest discriminative
  task, with boosting compliant convergence. We test our algorithms on tasks including
  fake/real distinction and missing data imputation.'
