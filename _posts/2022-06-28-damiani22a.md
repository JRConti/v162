title: Balancing Sample Efficiency and Suboptimality in Inverse Reinforcement Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We propose a novel formulation for the Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL)
  problem, which jointly accounts for the compatibility with the expert behavior of
  the identified reward and its effectiveness for the subsequent forward learning
  phase. Albeit quite natural, especially when the final goal is apprenticeship learning
  (learning policies from an expert), this aspect has been completely overlooked by
  IRL approaches so far. We propose a new model-free IRL method that is remarkably
  able to autonomously find a trade-off between the error induced on the learned policy
  when potentially choosing a sub-optimal reward, and the estimation error caused
  by using finite samples in the forward learning phase, which can be controlled by
  explicitly optimizing also the discount factor of the related learning problem.
  The approach is based on a min-max formulation for the robust selection of the reward
  parameters and the discount factor so that the distance between the expertâ€™s policy
  and the learned policy is minimized in the successive forward learning task when
  a finite and possibly small number of samples is available. Differently from the
  majority of other IRL techniques, our approach does not involve any planning or
  forward Reinforcement Learning problems to be solved. After presenting the formulation,
  we provide a numerical scheme for the optimization, and we show its effectiveness
  on an illustrative numerical case.
