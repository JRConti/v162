title: 'DisPFL: Towards Communication-Efficient Personalized Federated Learning via
  Decentralized Sparse Training'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Personalized federated learning is proposed to handle the data heterogeneity
  problem amongst clients by learning dedicated tailored local models for each user.
  However, existing works are often built in a centralized way, leading to high communication
  pressure and high vulnerability when a failure or an attack on the central server
  occurs. In this work, we propose a novel personalized federated learning framework
  in a decentralized (peer-to-peer) communication protocol named DisPFL, which employs
  personalized sparse masks to customize sparse local models on the edge. To further
  save the communication and computation cost, we propose a decentralized sparse training
  technique, which means that each local model in DisPFL only maintains a fixed number
  of active parameters throughout the whole local training and peer-to-peer communication
  process. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that DisPFL significantly saves the
  communication bottleneck for the busiest node among all clients and, at the same
  time, achieves higher model accuracy with less computation cost and communication
  rounds. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method can easily adapt to heterogeneous
  local clients with varying computation complexities and achieves better personalized
  performances.
