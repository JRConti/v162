title: Data-Efficient Double-Win Lottery Tickets from Robust Pre-training
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Pre-training serves as a broadly adopted starting point for transfer learning
  on various downstream tasks. Recent investigations of lottery tickets hypothesis
  (LTH) demonstrate such enormous pre-trained models can be replaced by extremely
  sparse subnetworks (a.k.a. matching subnetworks) without sacrificing transferability.
  However, practical security-crucial applications usually pose more challenging requirements
  beyond standard transfer, which also demand these subnetworks to overcome adversarial
  vulnerability. In this paper, we formulate a more rigorous concept, Double-Win Lottery
  Tickets, in which a located subnetwork from a pre-trained model can be independently
  transferred on diverse downstream tasks, to reach BOTH the same standard and robust
  generalization, under BOTH standard and adversarial training regimes, as the full
  pre-trained model can do. We comprehensively examine various pre-training mechanisms
  and find that robust pre-training tends to craft sparser double-win lottery tickets
  with superior performance over the standard counterparts. For example, on downstream
  CIFAR-10/100 datasets, we identify double-win matching subnetworks with the standard,
  fast adversarial, and adversarial pre-training from ImageNet, at 89.26%/73.79%,
  89.26%/79.03%, and 91.41%/83.22% sparsity, respectively. Furthermore, we observe
  the obtained double-win lottery tickets can be more data-efficient to transfer,
  under practical data-limited (e.g., 1% and 10%) downstream schemes. Our results
  show that the benefits from robust pre-training are amplified by the lottery ticket
  scheme, as well as the data-limited transfer setting. Codes are available at https://github.com/VITA-Group/Double-Win-LTH.
