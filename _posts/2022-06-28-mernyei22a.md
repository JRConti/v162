title: Equivariant Quantum Graph Circuits
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We investigate quantum circuits for graph representation learning, and propose
  equivariant quantum graph circuits (EQGCs), as a class of parameterized quantum
  circuits with strong relational inductive bias for learning over graph-structured
  data. Conceptually, EQGCs serve as a unifying framework for quantum graph representation
  learning, allowing us to define several interesting subclasses which subsume existing
  proposals. In terms of the representation power, we prove that the studied subclasses
  of EQGCs are universal approximators for functions over the bounded graph domain.
  This theoretical perspective on quantum graph machine learning methods opens many
  directions for further work, and could lead to models with capabilities beyond those
  of classical approaches. We empirically verify the expressive power of EQGCs through
  a dedicated experiment on synthetic data, and additionally observe that the performance
  of EQGCs scales well with the depth of the model and does not suffer from barren
  plateu issues.
