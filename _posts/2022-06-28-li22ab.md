title: 'HousE: Knowledge Graph Embedding with Householder Parameterization'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'The effectiveness of knowledge graph embedding (KGE) largely depends on
  the ability to model intrinsic relation patterns and mapping properties. However,
  existing approaches can only capture some of them with insufficient modeling capacity.
  In this work, we propose a more powerful KGE framework named HousE, which involves
  a novel parameterization based on two kinds of Householder transformations: (1)
  Householder rotations to achieve superior capacity of modeling relation patterns;
  (2) Householder projections to handle sophisticated relation mapping properties.
  Theoretically, HousE is capable of modeling crucial relation patterns and mapping
  properties simultaneously. Besides, HousE is a generalization of existing rotation-based
  models while extending the rotations to high-dimensional spaces. Empirically, HousE
  achieves new state-of-the-art performance on five benchmark datasets. Our code is
  available at https://github.com/anrep/HousE.'
