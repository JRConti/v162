abstract: 'In this paper, we propose a Collaboration of Experts (CoE) framework to
  assemble the expertise of multiple networks towards a common goal. Each expert is
  an individual network with expertise on a unique portion of the dataset, contributing
  to the collective capacity. Given a sample, delegator selects an expert and simultaneously
  outputs a rough prediction to trigger potential early termination. For each model
  in CoE, we propose a novel training algorithm with two major components: weight
  generation module (WGM) and label generation module (LGM). It fulfills the co-adaptation
  of experts and delegator. WGM partitions the training data into portions based on
  delegator via solving a balanced transportation problem, then impels each expert
  to focus on one portion by reweighting the losses. LGM generates the label to constitute
  the loss of delegator for expert selection. CoE achieves the state-of-the-art performance
  on ImageNet, 80.7% top-1 accuracy with 194M FLOPs. Combined with PWLU and CondConv,
  CoE further boosts the accuracy to 80.0% with only 100M FLOPs for the first time.
  Furthermore, experiment results on the translation task also demonstrate the strong
  generalizability of CoE. CoE is hardware-friendly, yielding a 3Â 6x acceleration
  compared with existing conditional computation approaches.'
