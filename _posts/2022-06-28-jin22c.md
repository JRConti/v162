title: 'The Power of Exploiter: Provable Multi-Agent RL in Large State Spaces'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Modern reinforcement learning (RL) commonly engages practical problems with
  large state spaces, where function approximation must be deployed to approximate
  either the value function or the policy. While recent progresses in RL theory address
  a rich set of RL problems with general function approximation, such successes are
  mostly restricted to the single-agent setting. It remains elusive how to extend
  these results to multi-agent RL, especially in the face of new game-theoretical
  challenges. This paper considers two-player zero-sum Markov Games (MGs). We propose
  a new algorithm that can provably find the Nash equilibrium policy using a polynomial
  number of samples, for any MG with low <em>multi-agent Bellman-Eluder dimension</em>â€”a
  new complexity measure adapted from its single-agent version (Jin et al., 2021).
  A key component of our new algorithm is the exploiter, which facilitates the learning
  of the main player by deliberately exploiting her weakness. Our theoretical framework
  is generic, which applies to a wide range of models including but not limited to
  tabular MGs, MGs with linear or kernel function approximation, and MGs with rich
  observations.
