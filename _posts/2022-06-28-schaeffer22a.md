title: Streaming Inference for Infinite Feature Models
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Unsupervised learning from a continuous stream of data is arguably one of
  the most common and most challenging problems facing intelligent agents. One class
  of unsupervised models, collectively termed <em>feature models</em>, attempts unsupervised
  discovery of latent features underlying the data and includes common models such
  as PCA, ICA, and NMF. However, if the data arrives in a continuous stream, determining
  the number of features is a significant challenge and the number may grow with time.
  In this work, we make feature models significantly more applicable to streaming
  data by imbuing them with the ability to create new features, online, in a probabilistic
  and principled manner. To achieve this, we derive a novel recursive form of the
  Indian Buffet Process, which we term the <em>Recursive IBP</em> (R-IBP). We demonstrate
  that R-IBP can be be used as a prior for feature models to efficiently infer a posterior
  over an unbounded number of latent features, with quasilinear average time complexity
  and logarithmic average space complexity. We compare R-IBP to existing offline sampling
  and variational baselines in two feature models (Linear Gaussian and Factor Analysis)
  and demonstrate on synthetic and real data that R-IBP achieves comparable or better
  performance in significantly less time.
