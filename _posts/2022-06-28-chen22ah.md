title: Sample and Communication-Efficient Decentralized Actor-Critic Algorithms with
  Finite-Time Analysis
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Actor-critic (AC) algorithms have been widely used in decentralized multi-agent
  systems to learn the optimal joint control policy. However, existing decentralized
  AC algorithms either need to share agents’ sensitive information or lack communication-efficiency.
  In this work, we develop decentralized AC and natural AC (NAC) algorithms that avoid
  sharing agents’ local information and are sample and communication-efficient. In
  both algorithms, agents share only noisy rewards and use mini-batch local policy
  gradient updates to ensure high sample and communication efficiency. Particularly
  for decentralized NAC, we develop a decentralized Markovian SGD algorithm with an
  adaptive mini-batch size to efficiently compute the natural policy gradient. Under
  Markovian sampling and linear function approximation, we prove that the proposed
  decentralized AC and NAC algorithms achieve the state-of-the-art sample complexities
  $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2}\ln\epsilon^{-1})$ and $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3}\ln\epsilon^{-1})$,
  respectively, and achieve an improved communication complexity $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1}\ln\epsilon^{-1})$.
  Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithms achieve lower sample
  and communication complexities than the existing decentralized AC algorithms.
