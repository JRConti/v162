title: Personalized Federated Learning through Local Memorization
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Federated learning allows clients to collaboratively learn statistical models
  while keeping their data local. Federated learning was originally used to train
  a unique global model to be served to all clients, but this approach might be sub-optimal
  when clientsâ€™ local data distributions are heterogeneous. In order to tackle this
  limitation, recent personalized federated learning methods train a separate model
  for each client while still leveraging the knowledge available at other clients.
  In this work, we exploit the ability of deep neural networks to extract high quality
  vectorial representations (embeddings) from non-tabular data, e.g., images and text,
  to propose a personalization mechanism based on local memorization. Personalization
  is obtained by interpolating a collectively trained global model with a local $k$-nearest
  neighbors (kNN) model based on the shared representation provided by the global
  model. We provide generalization bounds for the proposed approach in the case of
  binary classification, and we show on a suite of federated datasets that this approach
  achieves significantly higher accuracy and fairness than state-of-the-art methods.
