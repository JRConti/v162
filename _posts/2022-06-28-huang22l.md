title: Going Deeper into Permutation-Sensitive Graph Neural Networks
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The invariance to permutations of the adjacency matrix, i.e., graph isomorphism,
  is an overarching requirement for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Conventionally,
  this prerequisite can be satisfied by the invariant operations over node permutations
  when aggregating messages. However, such an invariant manner may ignore the relationships
  among neighboring nodes, thereby hindering the expressivity of GNNs. In this work,
  we devise an efficient permutation-sensitive aggregation mechanism via permutation
  groups, capturing pairwise correlations between neighboring nodes. We prove that
  our approach is strictly more powerful than the 2-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman
  (2-WL) graph isomorphism test and not less powerful than the 3-WL test. Moreover,
  we prove that our approach achieves the linear sampling complexity. Comprehensive
  experiments on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority
  of our model.
