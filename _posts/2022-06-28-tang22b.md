title: Rethinking Graph Neural Networks for Anomaly Detection
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely applied for graph anomaly detection.
  As one of the key components for GNN design is to select a tailored spectral filter,
  we take the first step towards analyzing anomalies via the lens of the graph spectrum.
  Our crucial observation is the existence of anomalies will lead to the ‘right-shift’
  phenomenon, that is, the spectral energy distribution concentrates less on low frequencies
  and more on high frequencies. This fact motivates us to propose the Beta Wavelet
  Graph Neural Network (BWGNN). Indeed, BWGNN has spectral and spatial localized band-pass
  filters to better handle the ‘right-shift’ phenomenon in anomalies. We demonstrate
  the effectiveness of BWGNN on four large-scale anomaly detection datasets. Our code
  and data are released at https://github.com/squareRoot3/Rethinking-Anomaly-Detection.
