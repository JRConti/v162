title: Optimal and Efficient Dynamic Regret Algorithms for Non-Stationary Dueling
  Bandits
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We study the problem of <em>dynamic regret minimization</em> in $K$-armed
  Dueling Bandits under non-stationary or time-varying preferences. This is an online
  learning setup where the agent chooses a pair of items at each round and observes
  only a relative binary ‘win-loss’ feedback for this pair sampled from an underlying
  preference matrix at that round. We first study the problem of static-regret minimization
  for adversarial preference sequences and design an efficient algorithm with $O(\sqrt{KT})$
  regret bound. We next use similar algorithmic ideas to propose an efficient and
  provably optimal algorithm for dynamic-regret minimization under two notions of
  non-stationarities. In particular, we show $\tO(\sqrt{SKT})$ and $\tO({V_T^{1/3}K^{1/3}T^{2/3}})$
  dynamic-regret guarantees, respectively, with $S$ being the total number of ‘effective-switches’
  in the underlying preference relations and $V_T$ being a measure of ‘continuous-variation’
  non-stationarity. These rates are provably optimal as justified with matching lower
  bound guarantees. Moreover, our proposed algorithms are flexible as they can be
  easily ‘blackboxed’ to yield dynamic regret guarantees for other notions of dueling
  bandits regret, including condorcet regret, best-response bounds, and Borda regret.
  The complexity of these problems have not been studied prior to this work despite
  the practicality of non-stationary environments. Our results are corroborated with
  extensive simulations.
