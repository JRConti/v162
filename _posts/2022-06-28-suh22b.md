title: Do Differentiable Simulators Give Better Policy Gradients?
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Differentiable simulators promise faster computation time for reinforcement
  learning by replacing zeroth-order gradient estimates of a stochastic objective
  with an estimate based on first-order gradients. However, it is yet unclear what
  factors decide the performance of the two estimators on complex landscapes that
  involve long-horizon planning and control on physical systems, despite the crucial
  relevance of this question for the utility of differentiable simulators. We show
  that characteristics of certain physical systems, such as stiffness or discontinuities,
  may compromise the efficacy of the first-order estimator, and analyze this phenomenon
  through the lens of bias and variance. We additionally propose an $\alpha$-order
  gradient estimator, with $\alpha \in [0,1]$, which correctly utilizes exact gradients
  to combine the efficiency of first-order estimates with the robustness of zero-order
  methods. We demonstrate the pitfalls of traditional estimators and the advantages
  of the $\alpha$-order estimator on some numerical examples.
