title: To Smooth or Not? When Label Smoothing Meets Noisy Labels
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Label smoothing (LS) is an arising learning paradigm that uses the positively
  weighted average of both the hard training labels and uniformly distributed soft
  labels. It was shown that LS serves as a regularizer for training data with hard
  labels and therefore improves the generalization of the model. Later it was reported
  LS even helps with improving robustness when learning with noisy labels. However,
  we observed that the advantage of LS vanishes when we operate in a high label noise
  regime. Intuitively speaking, this is due to the increased entropy of P(noisy label|X)
  when the noise rate is high, in which case, further applying LS tends to “over-smooth”
  the estimated posterior. We proceeded to discover that several learning-with-noisy-labels
  solutions in the literature instead relate more closely to negative/not label smoothing
  (NLS), which acts counter to LS and defines as using a negative weight to combine
  the hard and soft labels! We provide understandings for the properties of LS and
  NLS when learning with noisy labels. Among other established properties, we theoretically
  show NLS is considered more beneficial when the label noise rates are high. We provide
  extensive experimental results on multiple benchmarks to support our findings too.
