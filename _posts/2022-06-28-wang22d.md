title: Neural Implicit Dictionary Learning via Mixture-of-Expert Training
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Representing visual signals by coordinate-based deep fully-connected networks
  has been shown advantageous in fitting complex details and solving inverse problems
  than discrete grid-based representation. However, acquiring such a continuous Implicit
  Neural Representation (INR) requires tedious per-scene training on tons of signal
  measurements, which limits its practicality. In this paper, we present a generic
  INR framework that achieves both data and training efficiency by learning a Neural
  Implicit Dictionary (NID) from a data collection and representing INR as a functional
  combination of wavelets sampled from the dictionary. Our NID assembles a group of
  coordinate-based subnetworks which are tuned to span the desired function space.
  After training, one can instantly and robustly acquire an unseen scene representation
  by solving the coding coefficients. To parallelly optimize a large group of networks,
  we borrow the idea from Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) to design and train our network
  with a sparse gating mechanism. Our experiments show that, NID can improve reconstruction
  of 2D images or 3D scenes by 2 orders of magnitude faster with up to 98% less input
  data. We further demonstrate various applications of NID in image inpainting and
  occlusion removal, which are considered to be challenging with vanilla INR. Our
  codes are available in https://github.com/VITA-Group/Neural-Implicit-Dict.
