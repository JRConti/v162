title: Functional Generalized Empirical Likelihood Estimation for Conditional Moment
  Restrictions
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Important problems in causal inference, economics, and, more generally,
  robust machine learning can be expressed as conditional moment restrictions, but
  estimation becomes challenging as it requires solving a continuum of unconditional
  moment restrictions. Previous works addressed this problem by extending the generalized
  method of moments (GMM) to continuum moment restrictions. In contrast, generalized
  empirical likelihood (GEL) provides a more general framework and has been shown
  to enjoy favorable small-sample properties compared to GMM-based estimators. To
  benefit from recent developments in machine learning, we provide a functional reformulation
  of GEL in which arbitrary models can be leveraged. Motivated by a dual formulation
  of the resulting infinite dimensional optimization problem, we devise a practical
  method and explore its asymptotic properties. Finally, we provide kernel- and neural
  network-based implementations of the estimator, which achieve state-of-the-art empirical
  performance on two conditional moment restriction problems.
