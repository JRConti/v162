title: A Hierarchical Bayesian Approach to Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Symbolic
  Reward Machines
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: A misspecified reward can degrade sample efficiency and induce undesired
  behaviors in reinforcement learning (RL) problems. We propose symbolic reward machines
  for incorporating high-level task knowledge when specifying the reward signals.
  Symbolic reward machines augment existing reward machine formalism by allowing transitions
  to carry predicates and symbolic reward outputs. This formalism lends itself well
  to inverse reinforcement learning, whereby the key challenge is determining appropriate
  assignments to the symbolic values from a few expert demonstrations. We propose
  a hierarchical Bayesian approach for inferring the most likely assignments such
  that the concretized reward machine can discriminate expert demonstrated trajectories
  from other trajectories with high accuracy. Experimental results show that learned
  reward machines can significantly improve training efficiency for complex RL tasks
  and generalize well across different task environment configurations.
