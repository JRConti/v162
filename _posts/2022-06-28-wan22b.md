title: Safe Exploration for Efficient Policy Evaluation and Comparison
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: High-quality data plays a central role in ensuring the accuracy of policy
  evaluation. This paper initiates the study of efficient and safe data collection
  for bandit policy evaluation. We formulate the problem and investigate its several
  representative variants. For each variant, we analyze its statistical properties,
  derive the corresponding exploration policy, and design an efficient algorithm for
  computing it. Both theoretical analysis and experiments support the usefulness of
  the proposed methods.
