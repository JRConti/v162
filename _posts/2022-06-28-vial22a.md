title: Regret Bounds for Stochastic Shortest Path Problems with Linear Function Approximation
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We propose an algorithm that uses linear function approximation (LFA) for
  stochastic shortest path (SSP). Under minimal assumptions, it obtains sublinear
  regret, is computationally efficient, and uses stationary policies. To our knowledge,
  this is the first such algorithm in the LFA literature (for SSP or other formulations).
  Our algorithm is a special case of a more general one, which achieves regret square
  root in the number of episodes given access to a computation oracle.
