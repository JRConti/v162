title: Provably Adversarially Robust Nearest Prototype Classifiers
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Nearest prototype classifiers (NPCs) assign to each input point the label
  of the nearest prototype with respect to a chosen distance metric. A direct advantage
  of NPCs is that the decisions are interpretable. Previous work could provide lower
  bounds on the minimal adversarial perturbation in the $\ell_p$-threat model when
  using the same $\ell_p$-distance for the NPCs. In this paper we provide a complete
  discussion on the complexity when using $\ell_p$-distances for decision and $\ell_q$-threat
  models for certification for $p,q \in \{1,2,\infty\}$. In particular we provide
  scalable algorithms for the <em>exact</em> computation of the minimal adversarial
  perturbation when using $\ell_2$-distance and improved lower bounds in other cases.
  Using efficient improved lower bounds we train our \textbf{P}rovably adversarially
  robust \textbf{NPC} (PNPC), for MNIST which have better $\ell_2$-robustness guarantees
  than neural networks. Additionally, we show up to our knowledge the first certification
  results w.r.t. to the LPIPS perceptual metric which has been argued to be a more
  realistic threat model for image classification than $\ell_p$-balls. Our PNPC has
  on CIFAR10 higher certified robust accuracy than the empirical robust accuracy reported
  in \cite{laidlaw2021perceptual}. The code is available in our \href{https://github.com/vvoracek/Provably-Adversarially-Robust-Nearest-Prototype-Classifiers}{repository}.
