title: Object Permanence Emerges in a Random Walk along Memory
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'This paper proposes a self-supervised objective for learning representations
  that localize objects under occlusion - a property known as object permanence. A
  central question is the choice of learning signal in cases of total occlusion. Rather
  than directly supervising the locations of invisible objects, we propose a self-supervised
  objective that requires neither human annotation, nor assumptions about object dynamics.
  We show that object permanence can emerge by optimizing for temporal coherence of
  memory: we fit a Markov walk along a space-time graph of memories, where the states
  in each time step are non-Markovian features from a sequence encoder. This leads
  to a memory representation that stores occluded objects and predicts their motion,
  to better localize them. The resulting model outperforms existing approaches on
  several datasets of increasing complexity and realism, despite requiring minimal
  supervision, and hence being broadly applicable.'
