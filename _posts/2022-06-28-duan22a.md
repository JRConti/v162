title: A Context-Integrated Transformer-Based Neural Network for Auction Design
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: One of the central problems in auction design is developing an incentive-compatible
  mechanism that maximizes the auctioneerâ€™s expected revenue. While theoretical approaches
  have encountered bottlenecks in multi-item auctions, recently, there has been much
  progress on finding the optimal mechanism through deep learning. However, these
  works either focus on a fixed set of bidders and items, or restrict the auction
  to be symmetric. In this work, we overcome such limitations by factoring <em>public</em>
  contextual information of bidders and items into the auction learning framework.
  We propose $\mathtt{CITransNet}$, a context-integrated transformer-based neural
  network for optimal auction design, which maintains permutation-equivariance over
  bids and contexts while being able to find asymmetric solutions. We show by extensive
  experiments that $\mathtt{CITransNet}$ can recover the known optimal solutions in
  single-item settings, outperform strong baselines in multi-item auctions, and generalize
  well to cases other than those in training.
