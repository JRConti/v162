title: Unsupervised Image Representation Learning with Deep Latent Particles
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We propose a new representation of visual data that disentangles object
  position from appearance. Our method, termed Deep Latent Particles (DLP), decomposes
  the visual input into low-dimensional latent “particles”, where each particle is
  described by its spatial location and features of its surrounding region. To drive
  learning of such representations, we follow a VAE-based based approach and introduce
  a prior for particle positions based on a spatial-Softmax architecture, and a modification
  of the evidence lower bound loss inspired by the Chamfer distance between particles.
  We demonstrate that our DLP representations are useful for downstream tasks such
  as unsupervised keypoint (KP) detection, image manipulation, and video prediction
  for scenes composed of multiple dynamic objects. In addition, we show that our probabilistic
  interpretation of the problem naturally provides uncertainty estimates for particle
  locations, which can be used for model selection, among other tasks.
