title: Learning to Infer Structures of Network Games
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Strategic interactions between a group of individuals or organisations can
  be modelled as games played on networks, where a playerâ€™s payoff depends not only
  on their actions but also on those of their neighbours. Inferring the network structure
  from observed game outcomes (equilibrium actions) is an important problem with numerous
  potential applications in economics and social sciences. Existing methods mostly
  require the knowledge of the utility function associated with the game, which is
  often unrealistic to obtain in real-world scenarios. We adopt a transformer-like
  architecture which correctly accounts for the symmetries of the problem and learns
  a mapping from the equilibrium actions to the network structure of the game without
  explicit knowledge of the utility function. We test our method on three different
  types of network games using both synthetic and real-world data, and demonstrate
  its effectiveness in network structure inference and superior performance over existing
  methods.
