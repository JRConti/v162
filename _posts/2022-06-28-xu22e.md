title: Unified Fourier-based Kernel and Nonlinearity Design for Equivariant Networks
  on Homogeneous Spaces
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We introduce a unified framework for group equivariant networks on homogeneous
  spaces derived from a Fourier perspective. We consider tensor-valued feature fields,
  before and after a convolutional layer. We present a unified derivation of kernels
  via the Fourier domain by leveraging the sparsity of Fourier coefficients of the
  lifted feature fields. The sparsity emerges when the stabilizer subgroup of the
  homogeneous space is a compact Lie group. We further introduce a nonlinear activation,
  via an elementwise nonlinearity on the regular representation after lifting and
  projecting back to the field through an equivariant convolution. We show that other
  methods treating features as the Fourier coefficients in the stabilizer subgroup
  are special cases of our activation. Experiments on $SO(3)$ and $SE(3)$ show state-of-the-art
  performance in spherical vector field regression, point cloud classification, and
  molecular completion.
