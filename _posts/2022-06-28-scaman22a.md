title: Convergence Rates of Non-Convex Stochastic Gradient Descent Under a Generic
  Lojasiewicz Condition and Local Smoothness
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Training over-parameterized neural networks involves the empirical minimization
  of highly non-convex objective functions. Recently, a large body of works provided
  theoretical evidence that, despite this non-convexity, properly initialized over-parameterized
  networks can converge to a zero training loss through the introduction of the Polyak-Lojasiewicz
  condition. However, these analyses are restricted to quadratic losses such as mean
  square error, and tend to indicate fast exponential convergence rates that are seldom
  observed in practice. In this work, we propose to extend these results by analyzing
  stochastic gradient descent under more generic Lojasiewicz conditions that are applicable
  to any convex loss function, thus extending the current theory to a larger panel
  of losses commonly used in practice such as cross-entropy. Moreover, our analysis
  provides high-probability bounds on the approximation error under sub-Gaussian gradient
  noise and only requires the local smoothness of the objective function, thus making
  it applicable to deep neural networks in realistic settings.
