title: Measuring the Effect of Training Data on Deep Learning Predictions via Randomized
  Experiments
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'We develop a new, principled algorithm for estimating the contribution
  of training data points to the behavior of a deep learning model, such as a specific
  prediction it makes. Our algorithm estimates the AME, a quantity that measures the
  expected (average) marginal effect of adding a data point to a subset of the training
  data, sampled from a given distribution. When subsets are sampled from the uniform
  distribution, the AME reduces to the well-known Shapley value. Our approach is inspired
  by causal inference and randomized experiments: we sample different subsets of the
  training data to train multiple submodels, and evaluate each submodel’s behavior.
  We then use a LASSO regression to jointly estimate the AME of each data point, based
  on the subset compositions. Under sparsity assumptions ($k \ll N$ datapoints have
  large AME), our estimator requires only $O(k\log N)$ randomized submodel trainings,
  improving upon the best prior Shapley value estimators.'
