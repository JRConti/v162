title: Flow-Guided Sparse Transformer for Video Deblurring
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Exploiting similar and sharper scene patches in spatio-temporal neighborhoods
  is critical for video deblurring. However, CNN-based methods show limitations in
  capturing long-range dependencies and modeling non-local self-similarity. In this
  paper, we propose a novel framework, Flow-Guided Sparse Transformer (FGST), for
  video deblurring. In FGST, we customize a self-attention module, Flow-Guided Sparse
  Window-based Multi-head Self-Attention (FGSW-MSA). For each $query$ element on the
  blurry reference frame, FGSW-MSA enjoys the guidance of the estimated optical flow
  to globally sample spatially sparse yet highly related $key$ elements corresponding
  to the same scene patch in neighboring frames. Besides, we present a Recurrent Embedding
  (RE) mechanism to transfer information from past frames and strengthen long-range
  temporal dependencies. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed FGST
  outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on both DVD and GOPRO datasets and yields
  visually pleasant results in real video deblurring. https://github.com/linjing7/VR-Baseline
