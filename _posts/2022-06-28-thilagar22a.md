title: Consistent Polyhedral Surrogates for Top-k Classification and Variants
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Top-$k$ classification is a generalization of multiclass classification
  used widely in information retrieval, image classification, and other extreme classification
  settings. Several hinge-like (piecewise-linear) surrogates have been proposed for
  the problem, yet all are either non-convex or inconsistent. For the proposed hinge-like
  surrogates that are convex (i.e., polyhedral), we apply the recent embedding framework
  of Finocchiaro et al. (2019; 2022) to determine the prediction problem for which
  the surrogate is consistent. These problems can all be interpreted as variants of
  top-$k$ classification, which may be better aligned with some applications. We leverage
  this analysis to derive constraints on the conditional label distributions under
  which these proposed surrogates become consistent for top-$k$. It has been further
  suggested that every convex hinge-like surrogate must be inconsistent for top-$k$.
  Yet, we use the same embedding framework to give the first consistent polyhedral
  surrogate for this problem.
