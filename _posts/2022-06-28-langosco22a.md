title: Goal Misgeneralization in Deep Reinforcement Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We study <em>goal misgeneralization</em>, a type of out-of-distribution
  robustness failure in reinforcement learning (RL). Goal misgeneralization occurs
  when an RL agent retains its capabilities out-of-distribution yet pursues the wrong
  goal. For instance, an agent might continue to competently avoid obstacles, but
  navigate to the wrong place. In contrast, previous works have typically focused
  on capability generalization failures, where an agent fails to do anything sensible
  at test time.We provide the first explicit empirical demonstrations of goal misgeneralization
  and present a partial characterization of its causes.
