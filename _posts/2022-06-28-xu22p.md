title: Langevin Monte Carlo for Contextual Bandits
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We study the efficiency of Thompson sampling for contextual bandits. Existing
  Thompson sampling-based algorithms need to construct a Laplace approximation (i.e.,
  a Gaussian distribution) of the posterior distribution, which is inefficient to
  sample in high dimensional applications for general covariance matrices. Moreover,
  the Gaussian approximation may not be a good surrogate for the posterior distribution
  for general reward generating functions. We propose an efficient posterior sampling
  algorithm, viz., Langevin Monte Carlo Thompson Sampling (LMC-TS), that uses Markov
  Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to directly sample from the posterior distribution
  in contextual bandits. Our method is computationally efficient since it only needs
  to perform noisy gradient descent updates without constructing the Laplace approximation
  of the posterior distribution. We prove that the proposed algorithm achieves the
  same sublinear regret bound as the best Thompson sampling algorithms for a special
  case of contextual bandits, viz., linear contextual bandits. We conduct experiments
  on both synthetic data and real-world datasets on different contextual bandit models,
  which demonstrates that directly sampling from the posterior is both computationally
  efficient and competitive in performance.
