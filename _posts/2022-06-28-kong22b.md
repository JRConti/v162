title: Simultaneously Learning Stochastic and Adversarial Bandits with General Graph
  Feedback
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The problem of online learning with graph feedback has been extensively
  studied in the literature due to its generality and potential to model various learning
  tasks. Existing works mainly study the adversarial and stochastic feedback separately.
  If the prior knowledge of the feedback mechanism is unavailable or wrong, such specially
  designed algorithms could suffer great loss. To avoid this problem, \citet{erez2021towards}
  try to optimize for both environments. However, they assume the feedback graphs
  are undirected and each vertex has a self-loop, which compromises the generality
  of the framework and may not be satisfied in applications. With a general feedback
  graph, the observation of an arm may not be available when this arm is pulled, which
  makes the exploration more expensive and the algorithms more challenging to perform
  optimally in both environments. In this work, we overcome this difficulty by a new
  trade-off mechanism with a carefully-designed proportion for exploration and exploitation.
  We prove the proposed algorithm simultaneously achieves $\mathrm{poly} \log T$ regret
  in the stochastic setting and minimax-optimal regret of $\tilde{O}(T^{2/3})$ in
  the adversarial setting where $T$ is the horizon and $\tilde{O}$ hides parameters
  independent of $T$ as well as logarithmic terms. To our knowledge, this is the first
  best-of-both-worlds result for general feedback graphs.
