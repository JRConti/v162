title: On the Surrogate Gap between Contrastive and Supervised Losses
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Contrastive representation learning encourages data representation to make
  semantically similar pairs closer than randomly drawn negative samples, which has
  been successful in various domains such as vision, language, and graphs. Recent
  theoretical studies have attempted to explain the benefit of the large negative
  sample size by upper-bounding the downstream classification loss with the contrastive
  loss. However, the previous surrogate bounds have two drawbacks: they are only legitimate
  for a limited range of negative sample sizes and prohibitively large even within
  that range. Due to these drawbacks, there still does not exist a consensus on how
  negative sample size theoretically correlates with downstream classification performance.
  Following the simplified setting where positive pairs are drawn from the true distribution
  (not generated by data augmentation; as supposed in previous studies), this study
  establishes surrogate upper and lower bounds for the downstream classification loss
  for all negative sample sizes that best explain the empirical observations on the
  negative sample size in the earlier studies. Our bounds suggest that the contrastive
  loss can be viewed as a surrogate objective of the downstream loss and larger negative
  sample sizes improve downstream classification because the surrogate gap between
  contrastive and supervised losses decays. We verify that our theory is consistent
  with experiments on synthetic, vision, and language datasets.'
