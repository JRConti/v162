title: General-purpose, long-context autoregressive modeling with Perceiver AR
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Real-world data is high-dimensional: a book, image, or musical performance
  can easily contain hundreds of thousands of elements even after compression. However,
  the most commonly used autoregressive models, Transformers, are prohibitively expensive
  to scale to the number of inputs and layers needed to capture this long-range structure.
  We develop Perceiver AR, an autoregressive, modality-agnostic architecture which
  uses cross-attention to map long-range inputs to a small number of latents while
  also maintaining end-to-end causal masking. Perceiver AR can directly attend to
  over a hundred thousand tokens, enabling practical long-context density estimation
  without the need for hand-crafted sparsity patterns or memory mechanisms. When trained
  on images or music, Perceiver AR generates outputs with clear long-term coherence
  and structure. Our architecture also obtains state-of-the-art likelihood on long-sequence
  benchmarks, including 64x64 ImageNet images and PG-19 books.'
