title: Geometric Multimodal Contrastive Representation Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Learning representations of multimodal data that are both informative and
  robust to missing modalities at test time remains a challenging problem due to the
  inherent heterogeneity of data obtained from different channels. To address it,
  we present a novel Geometric Multimodal Contrastive (GMC) representation learning
  method consisting of two main components: i) a two-level architecture consisting
  of modality-specific base encoders, allowing to process an arbitrary number of modalities
  to an intermediate representation of fixed dimensionality, and a shared projection
  head, mapping the intermediate representations to a latent representation space;
  ii) a multimodal contrastive loss function that encourages the geometric alignment
  of the learned representations. We experimentally demonstrate that GMC representations
  are semantically rich and achieve state-of-the-art performance with missing modality
  information on three different learning problems including prediction and reinforcement
  learning tasks.'
