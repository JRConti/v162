title: Weisfeiler-Lehman Meets Gromov-Wasserstein
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test is a classical procedure for graph isomorphism
  testing. The WL test has also been widely used both for designing graph kernels
  and for analyzing graph neural networks. In this paper, we propose the Weisfeiler-Lehman
  (WL) distance, a notion of distance between labeled measure Markov chains (LMMCs),
  of which labeled graphs are special cases. The WL distance is polynomial time computable
  and is also compatible with the WL test in the sense that the former is positive
  if and only if the WL test can distinguish the two involved graphs. The WL distance
  captures and compares subtle structures of the underlying LMMCs and, as a consequence
  of this, it is more discriminating than the distance between graphs used for defining
  the state-of-the-art Wasserstein Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernel. Inspired by the
  structure of the WL distance we identify a neural network architecture on LMMCs
  which turns out to be universal w.r.t. continuous functions defined on the space
  of all LMMCs (which includes all graphs) endowed with the WL distance. Finally,
  the WL distance turns out to be stable w.r.t. a natural variant of the Gromov-Wasserstein
  (GW) distance for comparing metric Markov chains that we identify. Hence, the WL
  distance can also be construed as a polynomial time lower bound for the GW distance
  which is in general NP-hard to compute.
