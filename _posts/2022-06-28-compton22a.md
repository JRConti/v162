title: 'Entropic Causal Inference: Graph Identifiability'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Entropic causal inference is a recent framework for learning the causal
  graph between two variables from observational data by finding the information-theoretically
  simplest structural explanation of the data, i.e., the model with smallest entropy.
  In our work, we first extend the causal graph identifiability result in the two-variable
  setting under relaxed assumptions. We then show the first identifiability result
  using the entropic approach for learning causal graphs with more than two nodes.
  Our approach utilizes the property that ancestrality between a source node and its
  descendants can be determined using the bivariate entropic tests. We provide a sound
  sequential peeling algorithm for general graphs that relies on this property. We
  also propose a heuristic algorithm for small graphs that shows strong empirical
  performance. We rigorously evaluate the performance of our algorithms on synthetic
  data generated from a variety of models, observing improvement over prior work.
  Finally we test our algorithms on real-world datasets.
