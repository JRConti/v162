title: Personalization Improves Privacy-Accuracy Tradeoffs in Federated Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Large-scale machine learning systems often involve data distributed across
  a collection of users. Federated learning algorithms leverage this structure by
  communicating model updates to a central server, rather than entire datasets. In
  this paper, we study stochastic optimization algorithms for a personalized federated
  learning setting involving local and global models subject to user-level (joint)
  differential privacy. While learning a private global model induces a cost of privacy,
  local learning is perfectly private. We provide generalization guarantees showing
  that coordinating local learning with private centralized learning yields a generically
  useful and improved tradeoff between accuracy and privacy. We illustrate our theoretical
  results with experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.
