title: Accelerating Bayesian Optimization for Biological Sequence Design with Denoising
  Autoencoders
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Bayesian optimization (BayesOpt) is a gold standard for query-efficient
  continuous optimization. However, its adoption for drug design has been hindered
  by the discrete, high-dimensional nature of the decision variables. We develop a
  new approach (LaMBO) which jointly trains a denoising autoencoder with a discriminative
  multi-task Gaussian process head, allowing gradient-based optimization of multi-objective
  acquisition functions in the latent space of the autoencoder. These acquisition
  functions allow LaMBO to balance the explore-exploit tradeoff over multiple design
  rounds, and to balance objective tradeoffs by optimizing sequences at many different
  points on the Pareto frontier. We evaluate LaMBO on two small-molecule design tasks,
  and introduce new tasks optimizing in silico and in vitro properties of large-molecule
  fluorescent proteins. In our experiments LaMBO outperforms genetic optimizers and
  does not require a large pretraining corpus, demonstrating that BayesOpt is practical
  and effective for biological sequence design.
