title: Selective Regression under Fairness Criteria
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Selective regression allows abstention from prediction if the confidence
  to make an accurate prediction is not sufficient. In general, by allowing a reject
  option, one expects the performance of a regression model to increase at the cost
  of reducing coverage (i.e., by predicting on fewer samples). However, as we show,
  in some cases, the performance of a minority subgroup can decrease while we reduce
  the coverage, and thus selective regression can magnify disparities between different
  sensitive subgroups. Motivated by these disparities, we propose new fairness criteria
  for selective regression requiring the performance of every subgroup to improve
  with a decrease in coverage. We prove that if a feature representation satisfies
  the <em>sufficiency</em> criterion or is <em>calibrated for mean and variance</em>,
  then the proposed fairness criteria is met. Further, we introduce two approaches
  to mitigate the performance disparity across subgroups: (a) by regularizing an upper
  bound of conditional mutual information under a Gaussian assumption and (b) by regularizing
  a contrastive loss for conditional mean and conditional variance prediction. The
  effectiveness of these approaches is demonstrated on synthetic and real-world datasets.'
