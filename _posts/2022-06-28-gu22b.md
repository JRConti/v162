title: Learning Pseudometric-based Action Representations for Offline Reinforcement
  Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Offline reinforcement learning is a promising approach for practical applications
  since it does not require interactions with real-world environments. However, existing
  offline RL methods only work well in environments with continuous or small discrete
  action spaces. In environments with large and discrete action spaces, such as recommender
  systems and dialogue systems, the performance of existing methods decreases drastically
  because they suffer from inaccurate value estimation for a large proportion of out-of-distribution
  (o.o.d.) actions. While recent works have demonstrated that online RL benefits from
  incorporating semantic information in action representations, unfortunately, they
  fail to learn reasonable relative distances between action representations, which
  is key to offline RL to reduce the influence of o.o.d. actions. This paper proposes
  an action representation learning framework for offline RL based on a pseudometric,
  which measures both the behavioral relation and the data-distributional relation
  between actions. We provide theoretical analysis on the continuity of the expected
  Q-values and the offline policy improvement using the learned action representations.
  Experimental results show that our methods significantly improve the performance
  of two typical offline RL methods in environments with large and discrete action
  spaces.
