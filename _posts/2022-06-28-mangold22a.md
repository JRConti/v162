title: Differentially Private Coordinate Descent for Composite Empirical Risk Minimization
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Machine learning models can leak information about the data used to train
  them. To mitigate this issue, Differentially Private (DP) variants of optimization
  algorithms like Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) have been designed to trade-off
  utility for privacy in Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) problems. In this paper,
  we propose Differentially Private proximal Coordinate Descent (DP-CD), a new method
  to solve composite DP-ERM problems. We derive utility guarantees through a novel
  theoretical analysis of inexact coordinate descent. Our results show that, thanks
  to larger step sizes, DP-CD can exploit imbalance in gradient coordinates to outperform
  DP-SGD. We also prove new lower bounds for composite DP-ERM under coordinate-wise
  regularity assumptions, that are nearly matched by DP-CD. For practical implementations,
  we propose to clip gradients using coordinate-wise thresholds that emerge from our
  theory, avoiding costly hyperparameter tuning. Experiments on real and synthetic
  data support our results, and show that DP-CD compares favorably with DP-SGD.
