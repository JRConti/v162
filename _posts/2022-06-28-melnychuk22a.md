title: Causal Transformer for Estimating Counterfactual Outcomes
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Estimating counterfactual outcomes over time from observational data is
  relevant for many applications (e.g., personalized medicine). Yet, state-of-the-art
  methods build upon simple long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, thus rendering
  inferences for complex, long-range dependencies challenging. In this paper, we develop
  a novel Causal Transformer for estimating counterfactual outcomes over time. Our
  model is specifically designed to capture complex, long-range dependencies among
  time-varying confounders. For this, we combine three transformer subnetworks with
  separate inputs for time-varying covariates, previous treatments, and previous outcomes
  into a joint network with in-between cross-attentions. We further develop a custom,
  end-to-end training procedure for our Causal Transformer. Specifically, we propose
  a novel counterfactual domain confusion loss to address confounding bias: it aims
  to learn adversarial balanced representations, so that they are predictive of the
  next outcome but non-predictive of the current treatment assignment. We evaluate
  our Causal Transformer based on synthetic and real-world datasets, where it achieves
  superior performance over current baselines. To the best of our knowledge, this
  is the first work proposing transformer-based architecture for estimating counterfactual
  outcomes from longitudinal data.'
