title: Knowledge-Grounded Self-Rationalization via Extractive and Natural Language
  Explanations
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Models that generate extractive rationales (i.e., subsets of features)
  or natural language explanations (NLEs) for their predictions are important for
  explainable AI. While an extractive rationale provides a quick view of the features
  most responsible for a prediction, an NLE allows for a comprehensive description
  of the decision-making process behind a prediction. However, current models that
  generate the best extractive rationales or NLEs often fall behind the state-of-the-art
  (SOTA) in terms of task performance. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing
  RExC, a self-rationalizing framework that grounds its predictions and two complementary
  types of explanations (NLEs and extractive rationales) in background knowledge.
  Our framework improves over previous methods by: (i) reaching SOTA task performance
  while also providing explanations, (ii) providing two types of explanations, while
  existing models usually provide only one type, and (iii) beating by a large margin
  the previous SOTA in terms of quality of both types of explanations. Furthermore,
  a perturbation analysis in RExC shows a high degree of association between explanations
  and predictions, a necessary property of faithful explanations.'
