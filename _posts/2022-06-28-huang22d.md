title: Frustratingly Easy Transferability Estimation
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Transferability estimation has been an essential tool in selecting a pre-trained
  model and the layers in it for transfer learning, to transfer, so as to maximize
  the performance on a target task and prevent negative transfer. Existing estimation
  algorithms either require intensive training on target tasks or have difficulties
  in evaluating the transferability between layers. To this end, we propose a simple,
  efficient, and effective transferability measure named TransRate. Through a single
  pass over examples of a target task, TransRate measures the transferability as the
  mutual information between features of target examples extracted by a pre-trained
  model and their labels. We overcome the challenge of efficient mutual information
  estimation by resorting to coding rate that serves as an effective alternative to
  entropy. From the perspective of feature representation, the resulting TransRate
  evaluates both completeness (whether features contain sufficient information of
  a target task) and compactness (whether features of each class are compact enough
  for good generalization) of pre-trained features. Theoretically, we have analyzed
  the close connection of TransRate to the performance after transfer learning. Despite
  its extraordinary simplicity in 10 lines of codes, TransRate performs remarkably
  well in extensive evaluations on 35 pre-trained models and 16 downstream tasks.
