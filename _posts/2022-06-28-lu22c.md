title: 'ModLaNets: Learning Generalisable Dynamics via Modularity and Physical Inductive
  Bias'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Deep learning models are able to approximate one specific dynamical system
  but struggle at learning generalisable dynamics, where dynamical systems obey the
  same laws of physics but contain different numbers of elements (e.g., double- and
  triple-pendulum systems). To relieve this issue, we proposed the Modular Lagrangian
  Network (ModLaNet), a structural neural network framework with modularity and physical
  inductive bias. This framework models the energy of each element using modularity
  and then construct the target dynamical system via Lagrangian mechanics. Modularity
  is beneficial for reusing trained networks and reducing the scale of networks and
  datasets. As a result, our framework can learn from the dynamics of simpler systems
  and extend to more complex ones, which is not feasible using other relevant physics-informed
  neural networks. We examine our framework for modelling double-pendulum or three-body
  systems with small training datasets, where our models achieve the best data efficiency
  and accuracy performance compared with counterparts. We also reorganise our models
  as extensions to model multi-pendulum and multi-body systems, demonstrating the
  intriguing reusable feature of our framework.
