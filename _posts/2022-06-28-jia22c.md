  Rewards'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We consider a price-based revenue management problem with reusable resources
  over a finite time horizon $T$. The problem finds important applications in car/bicycle
  rental, ridesharing, cloud computing, and hospitality management. Customers arrive
  following a price-dependent Poisson process and each customer requests one unit
  of $c$ homogeneous reusable resources. If there is an available unit, the customer
  gets served within a price-dependent exponentially distributed service time; otherwise,
  she waits in a queue until the next available unit. The decision maker assumes that
  the inter-arrival and service intervals have an unknown linear dependence on a $d_f$-dimensional
  feature vector associated with the posted price. We propose a rate-optimal online
  learning and pricing algorithm, termed Batch Linear Confidence Bound (BLinUCB),
  and prove that the cumulative regret is $\tilde{O}( d_f \sqrt{T } )$. In establishing
  the regret, we bound the transient system performance upon price changes via a coupling
  argument, and also generalize linear bandits to accommodate sub-exponential rewards.
