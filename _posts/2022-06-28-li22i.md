title: Decomposing Temporal High-Order Interactions via Latent ODEs
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: "High-order interactions between multiple objects are common in real-world
  applications. Although tensor decomposition is a popular framework for high-order
  interaction analysis and prediction, most methods cannot well exploit the valuable
  timestamp information in data. The existent methods either discard the timestamps
  or convert them into discrete steps or use over-simplistic decomposition models.
  As a result, these methods might not be capable enough of capturing complex, fine-grained
  temporal dynamics or making accurate predictions for long-term interaction results.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Temporal High-order Interaction
  decompoSition model based on Ordinary Differential Equations (THIS-ODE). We model
  the time-varying interaction result with a latent ODE. To capture the complex temporal
  dynamics, we use a neural network (NN) to learn the time derivative of the ODE state.
  We use the representation of the interaction objects to model the initial value
  of the ODE and to constitute a part of the NN input to compute the state. In this
  way, the temporal relationships of the participant objects can be estimated and
  encoded into their representations. \tFor tractable and scalable inference, we use
  forward sensitivity analysis to efficiently compute the gradient of ODE state, based
  on which we use integral transform to develop a stochastic mini-batch learning algorithm.
  We demonstrate the advantage of our approach in simulation and four real-world applications."
