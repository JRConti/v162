title: Convergence of Uncertainty Sampling for Active Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Uncertainty sampling in active learning is heavily used in practice to reduce
  the annotation cost. However, there has been no wide consensus on the function to
  be used for uncertainty estimation in binary classification tasks and convergence
  guarantees of the corresponding active learning algorithms are not well understood.
  The situation is even more challenging for multi-category classification. In this
  work, we propose an efficient uncertainty estimator for binary classification which
  we also extend to multiple classes, and provide a non-asymptotic rate of convergence
  for our uncertainty sampling based active learning algorithm in both cases under
  no-noise conditions (i.e., linearly separable data). We also extend our analysis
  to the noisy case and provide theoretical guarantees for our algorithm under the
  influence of noise in the task of binary and multi-class classification.
