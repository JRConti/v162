title: The Primacy Bias in Deep Reinforcement Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'This work identifies a common flaw of deep reinforcement learning (RL)
  algorithms: a tendency to rely on early interactions and ignore useful evidence
  encountered later. Because of training on progressively growing datasets, deep RL
  agents incur a risk of overfitting to earlier experiences, negatively affecting
  the rest of the learning process. Inspired by cognitive science, we refer to this
  effect as the primacy bias. Through a series of experiments, we dissect the algorithmic
  aspects of deep RL that exacerbate this bias. We then propose a simple yet generally-applicable
  mechanism that tackles the primacy bias by periodically resetting a part of the
  agent. We apply this mechanism to algorithms in both discrete (Atari 100k) and continuous
  action (DeepMind Control Suite) domains, consistently improving their performance.'
