title: 'Tackling Data Heterogeneity: A New Unified Framework for Decentralized SGD
  with Sample-induced Topology'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We develop a general framework unifying several gradient-based stochastic
  optimization methods for empirical risk minimization problems both in centralized
  and distributed scenarios. The framework hinges on the introduction of an augmented
  graph consisting of nodes modeling the samples and edges modeling both the inter-device
  communication and intra-device stochastic gradient computation. By designing properly
  the topology of the augmented graph, we are able to recover as special cases the
  renowned Local-SGD and DSGD algorithms, and provide a unified perspective for variance-reduction
  (VR) and gradient-tracking (GT) methods such as SAGA, Local-SVRG and GT-SAGA. We
  also provide a unified convergence analysis for smooth and (strongly) convex objectives
  relying on a proper structured Lyapunov function, and the obtained rate can recover
  the best known results for many existing algorithms. The rate results further reveal
  that VR and GT methods can effectively eliminate data heterogeneity within and across
  devices, respectively, enabling the exact convergence of the algorithm to the optimal
  solution. Numerical experiments confirm the findings in this paper.
