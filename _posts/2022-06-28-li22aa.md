title: Double Sampling Randomized Smoothing
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Neural networks (NNs) are known to be vulnerable against adversarial perturbations,
  and thus there is a line of work aiming to provide robustness certification for
  NNs, such as randomized smoothing, which samples smoothing noises from a certain
  distribution to certify the robustness for a smoothed classifier. However, as previous
  work shows, the certified robust radius in randomized smoothing suffers from scaling
  to large datasets ("curse of dimensionality"). To overcome this hurdle, we propose
  a Double Sampling Randomized Smoothing (DSRS) framework, which exploits the sampled
  probability from an additional smoothing distribution to tighten the robustness
  certification of the previous smoothed classifier. Theoretically, under mild assumptions,
  we prove that DSRS can certify $\Theta(\sqrt d)$ robust radius under $\ell_2$ norm
  where $d$ is the input dimension, which implies that DSRS may be able to break the
  curse of dimensionality of randomized smoothing. We instantiate DSRS for a generalized
  family of Gaussian smoothing and propose an efficient and sound computing method
  based on customized dual optimization considering sampling error. Extensive experiments
  on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet verify our theory and show that DSRS certifies
  larger robust radii than existing baselines consistently under different settings.
