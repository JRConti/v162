title: Feature Space Particle Inference for Neural Network Ensembles
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Ensembles of deep neural networks demonstrate improved performance over
  single models. For enhancing the diversity of ensemble members while keeping their
  performance, particle-based inference methods offer a promising approach from a
  Bayesian perspective. However, the best way to apply these methods to neural networks
  is still unclear: seeking samples from the weight-space posterior suffers from inefficiency
  due to the over-parameterization issues, while seeking samples directly from the
  function-space posterior often leads to serious underfitting. In this study, we
  propose to optimize particles in the feature space where activations of a specific
  intermediate layer lie to alleviate the abovementioned difficulties. Our method
  encourages each member to capture distinct features, which are expected to increase
  the robustness of the ensemble prediction. Extensive evaluation on real-world datasets
  exhibits that our model significantly outperforms the gold-standard Deep Ensembles
  on various metrics, including accuracy, calibration, and robustness.'
