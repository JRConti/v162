title: 'Skin Deep Unlearning: Artefact and Instrument Debiasing in the Context of
  Melanoma Classification'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks have demonstrated dermatologist-level performance
  in the classification of melanoma from skin lesion images, but prediction irregularities
  due to biases seen within the training data are an issue that should be addressed
  before widespread deployment is possible. In this work, we robustly remove bias
  and spurious variation from an automated melanoma classification pipeline using
  two leading bias unlearning techniques. We show that the biases introduced by surgical
  markings and rulers presented in previous studies can be reasonably mitigated using
  these bias removal methods. We also demonstrate the generalisation benefits of unlearning
  spurious variation relating to the imaging instrument used to capture lesion images.
  Our experimental results provide evidence that the effects of each of the aforementioned
  biases are notably reduced, with different debiasing techniques excelling at different
  tasks.
