title: Utility Theory for Sequential Decision Making
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The von Neumann-Morgenstern (VNM) utility theorem shows that under certain
  axioms of rationality, decision-making is reduced to maximizing the expectation
  of some utility function. We extend these axioms to increasingly structured sequential
  decision making settings and identify the structure of the corresponding utility
  functions. In particular, we show that memoryless preferences lead to a utility
  in the form of a per transition reward and multiplicative factor on the future return.
  This result motivates a generalization of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with
  this structure on the agentâ€™s returns, which we call Affine-Reward MDPs. A stronger
  constraint on preferences is needed to recover the commonly used cumulative sum
  of scalar rewards in MDPs. A yet stronger constraint simplifies the utility function
  for goal-seeking agents in the form of a difference in some function of states that
  we call potential functions. Our necessary and sufficient conditions demystify the
  reward hypothesis that underlies the design of rational agents in reinforcement
  learning by adding an axiom to the VNM rationality axioms and motivates new directions
  for AI research involving sequential decision making.
