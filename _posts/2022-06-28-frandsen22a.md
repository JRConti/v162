title: Extracting Latent State Representations with Linear Dynamics from Rich Observations
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Recently, many reinforcement learning techniques have been shown to have
  provable guarantees in the simple case of linear dynamics, especially in problems
  like linear quadratic regulators. However, in practice many tasks require learning
  a policy from rich, high-dimensional features such as images, which are unlikely
  to be linear. We consider a setting where there is a hidden linear subspace of the
  high-dimensional feature space in which the dynamics are linear. We design natural
  objectives based on forward and inverse dynamics models. We prove that these objectives
  can be efficiently optimized and their local optimizers extract the hidden linear
  subspace. We empirically verify our theoretical results with synthetic data and
  explore the effectiveness of our approach (generalized to nonlinear settings) in
  simple control tasks with rich observations.
