title: Towards Uniformly Superhuman Autonomy via Subdominance Minimization
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Prevalent imitation learning methods seek to produce behavior that matches
  or exceeds average human performance. This often prevents achieving expert-level
  or superhuman performance when identifying the better demonstrations to imitate
  is difficult. We instead assume demonstrations are of varying quality and seek to
  induce behavior that is unambiguously better (i.e., Pareto dominant or minimally
  subdominant) than all human demonstrations. Our minimum subdominance inverse optimal
  control training objective is primarily defined by high quality demonstrations;
  lower quality demonstrations, which are more easily dominated, are effectively ignored
  instead of degrading imitation. With increasing probability, our approach produces
  superhuman behavior incurring lower cost than demonstrations on the demonstrator’s
  unknown cost function{—}even if that cost function differs for each demonstration.
  We apply our approach on a computer cursor pointing task, producing behavior that
  is 78% superhuman, while minimizing demonstration suboptimality provides 50% superhuman
  behavior{—}and only 72% even after selective data cleaning.
