title: One-Pass Diversified Sampling with Application to Terabyte-Scale Genomic Sequence
  Streams
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: A popular approach to reduce the size of a massive dataset is to apply efficient
  online sampling to the stream of data as it is read or generated. Online sampling
  routines are currently restricted to variations of reservoir sampling, where each
  sample is selected uniformly and independently of other samples. This renders them
  unsuitable for large-scale applications in computational biology, such as metagenomic
  community profiling and protein function annotation, which suffer from severe class
  imbalance. To maintain a representative and diverse sample, we must identify and
  preferentially select data that are likely to belong to rare classes. We argue that
  existing schemes for diversity sampling have prohibitive overhead for large-scale
  problems and high-throughput streams. We propose an efficient sampling routine that
  uses an online representation of the data distribution as a prefilter to retain
  elements from rare groups. We apply this method to several genomic data analysis
  tasks and demonstrate significant speedup in downstream analysis without sacrificing
  the quality of the results. Because our algorithm is 2x faster and uses 1000x less
  memory than coreset, reservoir and sketch-based alternatives, we anticipate that
  it will become a useful preprocessing step for applications with large-scale streaming
  data.
