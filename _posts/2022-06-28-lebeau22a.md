abstract: 'This article introduces a random matrix framework for the analysis of clustering
  on high-dimensional data streams, a particularly relevant setting for a more sober
  processing of large amounts of data with limited memory and energy resources. Assuming
  data $\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2, \ldots$ arrives as a continuous flow and a small
  number $L$ of them can be kept in the learning pipeline, one has only access to
  the diagonal elements of the Gram kernel matrix: $\left[ \mathbf{K}_L \right]_{i,
  j} = \frac{1}{p} \mathbf{x}_i^\top \mathbf{x}_j \mathbf{1}_{\left\lvert i - j \right\rvert
  < L}$. Under a large-dimensional data regime, we derive the limiting spectral distribution
  of the banded kernel matrix $\mathbf{K}_L$ and study its isolated eigenvalues and
  eigenvectors, which behave in an unfamiliar way. We detail how these results can
  be used to perform efficient online kernel spectral clustering and provide theoretical
  performance guarantees. Our findings are empirically confirmed on image clustering
  tasks. Leveraging on optimality results of spectral methods for clustering, this
  work offers insights on efficient online clustering techniques for high-dimensional
  data.'
