title: Score-based Generative Modeling of Graphs via the System of Stochastic Differential
  Equations
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Generating graph-structured data requires learning the underlying distribution
  of graphs. Yet, this is a challenging problem, and the previous graph generative
  methods either fail to capture the permutation-invariance property of graphs or
  cannot sufficiently model the complex dependency between nodes and edges, which
  is crucial for generating real-world graphs such as molecules. To overcome such
  limitations, we propose a novel score-based generative model for graphs with a continuous-time
  framework. Specifically, we propose a new graph diffusion process that models the
  joint distribution of the nodes and edges through a system of stochastic differential
  equations (SDEs). Then, we derive novel score matching objectives tailored for the
  proposed diffusion process to estimate the gradient of the joint log-density with
  respect to each component, and introduce a new solver for the system of SDEs to
  efficiently sample from the reverse diffusion process. We validate our graph generation
  method on diverse datasets, on which it either achieves significantly superior or
  competitive performance to the baselines. Further analysis shows that our method
  is able to generate molecules that lie close to the training distribution yet do
  not violate the chemical valency rule, demonstrating the effectiveness of the system
  of SDEs in modeling the node-edge relationships.
