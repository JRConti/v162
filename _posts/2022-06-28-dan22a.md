title: Understanding Robust Generalization in Learning Regular Languages
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: A key feature of human intelligence is the ability to generalize beyond
  the training distribution, for instance, parsing longer sentences than seen in the
  past. Currently, deep neural networks struggle to generalize robustly to such shifts
  in the data distribution. We study robust generalization in the context of using
  recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to learn regular languages. We hypothesize that
  standard end-to-end modeling strategies cannot generalize well to systematic distribution
  shifts and propose a compositional strategy to address this. We compare an end-to-end
  strategy that maps strings to labels with a compositional strategy that predicts
  the structure of the deterministic finite state automaton (DFA) that accepts the
  regular language. We theoretically prove that the compositional strategy generalizes
  significantly better than the end-to-end strategy. In our experiments, we implement
  the compositional strategy via an auxiliary task where the goal is to predict the
  intermediate states visited by the DFA when parsing a string. Our empirical results
  support our hypothesis, showing that auxiliary tasks can enable robust generalization.
  Interestingly, the end-to-end RNN generalizes significantly better than the theoretical
  lower bound, suggesting that it is able to achieve atleast some degree of robust
  generalization.
