title: Fishing for User Data in Large-Batch Federated Learning via Gradient Magnification
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Federated learning (FL) has rapidly risen in popularity due to its promise
  of privacy and efficiency. Previous works have exposed privacy vulnerabilities in
  the FL pipeline by recovering user data from gradient updates. However, existing
  attacks fail to address realistic settings because they either 1) require toy settings
  with very small batch sizes, or 2) require unrealistic and conspicuous architecture
  modifications. We introduce a new strategy that dramatically elevates existing attacks
  to operate on batches of arbitrarily large size, and without architectural modifications.
  Our model-agnostic strategy only requires modifications to the model parameters
  sent to the user, which is a realistic threat model in many scenarios. We demonstrate
  the strategy in challenging large-scale settings, obtaining high-fidelity data extraction
  in both cross-device and cross-silo federated learning. Code is available at https://github.com/JonasGeiping/breaching.
