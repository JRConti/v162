title: Efficient Low Rank Convex Bounds for Pairwise Discrete Graphical Models
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In this paper, we extend a Burer-Monteiro style method to compute low rank
  Semi-Definite Programming (SDP) bounds for the MAP problem on discrete graphical
  models with an arbitrary number of states and arbitrary pairwise potentials. We
  consider both a penalized constraint approach and a dedicated Block Coordinate Descent
  (BCD) approach which avoids large penalty coefficients in the cost matrix. We show
  our algorithm is decreasing. Experiments show that the BCD approach compares favorably
  to the penalized approach and to usual linear bounds relying on convergent message
  passing approaches.
