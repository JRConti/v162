title: 'Beyond Worst-Case Analysis in Stochastic Approximation: Moment Estimation
  Improves Instance Complexity'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We study oracle complexity of gradient based methods for stochastic approximation
  problems. Though in many settings optimal algorithms and tight lower bounds are
  known for such problems, these optimal algorithms do not achieve the best performance
  when used in practice. We address this theory-practice gap by focusing on <em>instance-dependent
  complexity</em> instead of worst case complexity. In particular, we first summarize
  known instance-dependent complexity results and categorize them into three levels.
  We identify the domination relation between different levels and propose a fourth
  instance-dependent bound that dominates existing ones. We then provide a sufficient
  condition according to which an adaptive algorithm with moment estimation can achieve
  the proposed bound without knowledge of noise levels. Our proposed algorithm and
  its analysis provide a theoretical justification for the success of moment estimation
  as it achieves improved instance complexity.
