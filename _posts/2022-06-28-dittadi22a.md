title: Generalization and Robustness Implications in Object-Centric Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The idea behind object-centric representation learning is that natural scenes
  can better be modeled as compositions of objects and their relations as opposed
  to distributed representations. This inductive bias can be injected into neural
  networks to potentially improve systematic generalization and performance of downstream
  tasks in scenes with multiple objects. In this paper, we train state-of-the-art
  unsupervised models on five common multi-object datasets and evaluate segmentation
  metrics and downstream object property prediction. In addition, we study generalization
  and robustness by investigating the settings where either a single object is out
  of distribution – e.g., having an unseen color, texture, or shape – or global properties
  of the scene are altered – e.g., by occlusions, cropping, or increasing the number
  of objects. From our experimental study, we find object-centric representations
  to be useful for downstream tasks and generally robust to most distribution shifts
  affecting objects. However, when the distribution shift affects the input in a less
  structured manner, robustness in terms of segmentation and downstream task performance
  may vary significantly across models and distribution shifts.
