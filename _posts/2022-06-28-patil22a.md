title: 'Align-RUDDER: Learning From Few Demonstrations by Reward Redistribution'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms require many samples when solving complex
  hierarchical tasks with sparse and delayed rewards. For such complex tasks, the
  recently proposed RUDDER uses reward redistribution to leverage steps in the Q-function
  that are associated with accomplishing sub-tasks. However, often only few episodes
  with high rewards are available as demonstrations since current exploration strategies
  cannot discover them in reasonable time. In this work, we introduce Align-RUDDER,
  which utilizes a profile model for reward redistribution that is obtained from multiple
  sequence alignment of demonstrations. Consequently, Align-RUDDER employs reward
  redistribution effectively and, thereby, drastically improves learning on few demonstrations.
  Align-RUDDER outperforms competitors on complex artificial tasks with delayed rewards
  and few demonstrations. On the Minecraft ObtainDiamond task, Align-RUDDER is able
  to mine a diamond, though not frequently. Code is available at github.com/ml-jku/align-rudder.
