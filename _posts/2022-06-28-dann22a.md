title: Guarantees for Epsilon-Greedy Reinforcement Learning with Function Approximation
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Myopic exploration policies such as epsilon-greedy, softmax, or Gaussian
  noise fail to explore efficiently in some reinforcement learning tasks and yet,
  they perform well in many others. In fact, in practice, they are often selected
  as the top choices, due to their simplicity. But, for what tasks do such policies
  succeed? Can we give theoretical guarantees for their favorable performance? These
  crucial questions have been scarcely investigated, despite the prominent practical
  importance of these policies. This paper presents a theoretical analysis of such
  policies and provides the first regret and sample-complexity bounds for reinforcement
  learning with myopic exploration. Our results apply to value-function-based algorithms
  in episodic MDPs with bounded Bellman Eluder dimension. We propose a new complexity
  measure called myopic exploration gap, denoted by alpha, that captures a structural
  property of the MDP, the exploration policy and the given value function class.
  We show that the sample-complexity of myopic exploration scales quadratically with
  the inverse of this quantity, 1 / alpha^2. We further demonstrate through concrete
  examples that myopic exploration gap is indeed favorable in several tasks where
  myopic exploration succeeds, due to the corresponding dynamics and reward structure.
