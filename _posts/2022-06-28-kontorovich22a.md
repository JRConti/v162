title: Adaptive Data Analysis with Correlated Observations
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The vast majority of the work on adaptive data analysis focuses on the case
  where the samples in the dataset are independent. Several approaches and tools have
  been successfully applied in this context, such as <em>differential privacy</em>,
  <em>max-information</em>, <em>compression arguments</em>, and more. The situation
  is far less well-understood without the independence assumption. We embark on a
  systematic study of the possibilities of adaptive data analysis with correlated
  observations. First, we show that, in some cases, differential privacy guarantees
  generalization even when there are dependencies within the sample, which we quantify
  using a notion we call <em>Gibbs-dependence</em>. We complement this result with
  a tight negative example. % Second, we show that the connection between transcript-compression
  and adaptive data analysis can be extended to the non-iid setting.
