abstract: What is the best way to exploit extra data – be it unlabeled data from the
  same task, or labeled data from a related task – to learn a given task? This paper
  formalizes the question using the theory of reference priors. Reference priors are
  objective, uninformative Bayesian priors that maximize the mutual information between
  the task and the weights of the model. Such priors enable the task to maximally
  affect the Bayesian posterior, e.g., reference priors depend upon the number of
  samples available for learning the task and for very small sample sizes, the prior
  puts more probability mass on low-complexity models in the hypothesis space. This
  paper presents the first demonstration of reference priors for medium-scale deep
  networks and image-based data. We develop generalizations of reference priors and
  demonstrate applications to two problems. First, by using unlabeled data to compute
  the reference prior, we develop new Bayesian semi-supervised learning methods that
  remain effective even with very few samples per class. Second, by using labeled
  data from the source task to compute the reference prior, we develop a new pretraining
  method for transfer learning that allows data from the target task to maximally
  affect the Bayesian posterior. Empirical validation of these methods is conducted
  on image classification datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/grasp-lyrl/deep_reference_priors
