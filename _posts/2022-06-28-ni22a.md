title: Recurrent Model-Free RL Can Be a Strong Baseline for Many POMDPs
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Many problems in RL, such as meta-RL, robust RL, generalization in RL, and
  temporal credit assignment, can be cast as POMDPs. In theory, simply augmenting
  model-free RL with memory-based architectures, such as recurrent neural networks,
  provides a general approach to solving all types of POMDPs. However, prior work
  has found that such recurrent model-free RL methods tend to perform worse than more
  specialized algorithms that are designed for specific types of POMDPs. This paper
  revisits this claim. We find that careful architecture and hyperparameter decisions
  can often yield a recurrent model-free implementation that performs on par with
  (and occasionally substantially better than) more sophisticated recent techniques.
  We compare to 21 environments from 6 prior specialized methods and find that our
  implementation achieves greater sample efficiency and asymptotic performance than
  these methods on 18/21 environments. We also release a simple and efficient implementation
  of recurrent model-free RL for future work to use as a baseline for POMDPs.
