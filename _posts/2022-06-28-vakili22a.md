title: Improved Convergence Rates for Sparse Approximation Methods in Kernel-Based
  Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Kernel-based models such as kernel ridge regression and Gaussian processes
  are ubiquitous in machine learning applications for regression and optimization.
  It is well known that a major downside for kernel-based models is the high computational
  cost; given a dataset of $n$ samples, the cost grows as $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$. Existing
  sparse approximation methods can yield a significant reduction in the computational
  cost, effectively reducing the actual cost down to as low as $\mathcal{O}(n)$ in
  certain cases. Despite this remarkable empirical success, significant gaps remain
  in the existing results for the analytical bounds on the error due to approximation.
  In this work, we provide novel confidence intervals for the Nystr√∂m method and the
  sparse variational Gaussian process approximation method, which we establish using
  novel interpretations of the approximate (surrogate) posterior variance of the models.
  Our confidence intervals lead to improved performance bounds in both regression
  and optimization problems.
