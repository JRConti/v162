title: How to Stay Curious while avoiding Noisy TVs using Aleatoric Uncertainty Estimation
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'When extrinsic rewards are sparse, artificial agents struggle to explore
  an environment. Curiosity, implemented as an intrinsic reward for prediction errors,
  can improve exploration but it is known to fail when faced with action-dependent
  noise sources (‘noisy TVs’). In an attempt to make exploring agents robust to Noisy
  TVs, we present a simple solution: aleatoric mapping agents (AMAs). AMAs are a novel
  form of curiosity that explicitly ascertain which state transitions of the environment
  are unpredictable, even if those dynamics are induced by the actions of the agent.
  This is achieved by generating separate forward predictions for the mean and aleatoric
  uncertainty of future states, with the aim of reducing intrinsic rewards for those
  transitions that are unpredictable. We demonstrate that in a range of environments
  AMAs are able to circumvent action-dependent stochastic traps that immobilise conventional
  curiosity driven agents. Furthermore, we demonstrate empirically that other common
  exploration approaches—previously thought to be immune to agent-induced randomness—can
  be trapped by stochastic dynamics.'
