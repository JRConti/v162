title: Efficient Online ML API Selection for Multi-Label Classification Tasks
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Multi-label classification tasks such as OCR and multi-object recognition
  are a major focus of the growing machine learning as a service industry. While many
  multi-label APIs are available, it is challenging for users to decide which API
  to use for their own data and budget, due to the heterogeneity in their prices and
  performance. Recent work has shown how to efficiently select and combine single
  label APIs to optimize performance and cost. However, its computation cost is exponential
  in the number of labels, and is not suitable for settings like OCR. In this work,
  we propose FrugalMCT, a principled framework that adaptively selects the APIs to
  use for different data in an online fashion while respecting the user’s budget.
  It allows combining ML APIs’ predictions for any single data point, and selects
  the best combination based on an accuracy estimator. We run systematic experiments
  using ML APIs from Google, Microsoft, Amazon, IBM, Tencent, and other providers
  for tasks including multi-label image classification, scene text recognition, and
  named entity recognition. Across these tasks, FrugalMCT can achieve over 90% cost
  reduction while matching the accuracy of the best single API, or up to 8% better
  accuracy while matching the best API’s cost.
