title: 'Dialog Inpainting: Turning Documents into Dialogs'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Many important questions (e.g. "How to eat healthier?") require conversation
  to establish context and explore in depth. However, conversational question answering
  (ConvQA) systems have long been stymied by scarce training data that is expensive
  to collect. To address this problem, we propose a new technique for synthetically
  generating diverse and high-quality dialog data: dialog inpainting. Our approach
  takes the text of any document and transforms it into a two-person dialog between
  the writer and an imagined reader: we treat sentences from the article as utterances
  spoken by the writer, and then use a dialog inpainter to predict what the imagined
  reader asked or said in between each of the writer’s utterances. By applying this
  approach to passages from Wikipedia and the web, we produce WikiDialog and WebDialog,
  two datasets totalling 19 million diverse information-seeking dialogs – 1,000x larger
  than the largest existing ConvQA dataset. Furthermore, human raters judge the answer
  adequacy and conversationality of WikiDialog to be as good or better than existing
  manually-collected datasets. Remarkably, our approach shows strong zero-shot capability,
  generating high quality synthetic data without using any in-domain ConvQA data.
  Using our inpainted data to pre-train ConvQA retrieval systems, we significantly
  advance state-of-the-art across three benchmarks (QReCC, OR-QuAC, TREC CAsT) yielding
  up to 40% relative gains on standard evaluation metrics.'
