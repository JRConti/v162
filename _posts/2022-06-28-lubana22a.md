title: 'Orchestra: Unsupervised Federated Learning via Globally Consistent Clustering'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Federated learning is generally used in tasks where labels are readily
  available (e.g., next word prediction). Relaxing this constraint requires design
  of unsupervised learning techniques that can support desirable properties for federated
  training: robustness to statistical/systems heterogeneity, scalability with number
  of participants, and communication efficiency. Prior work on this topic has focused
  on directly extending centralized self-supervised learning techniques, which are
  not designed to have the properties listed above. To address this situation, we
  propose Orchestra, a novel unsupervised federated learning technique that exploits
  the federation’s hierarchy to orchestrate a distributed clustering task and enforce
  a globally consistent partitioning of clients’ data into discriminable clusters.
  We show the algorithmic pipeline in Orchestra guarantees good generalization performance
  under a linear probe, allowing it to outperform alternative techniques in a broad
  range of conditions, including variation in heterogeneity, number of clients, participation
  ratio, and local epochs.'
