title: Bregman Proximal Langevin Monte Carlo via Bregman-Moreau Envelopes
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We propose efficient Langevin Monte Carlo algorithms for sampling distributions
  with nonsmooth convex composite potentials, which is the sum of a continuously differentiable
  function and a possibly nonsmooth function. We devise such algorithms leveraging
  recent advances in convex analysis and optimization methods involving Bregman divergences,
  namely the Bregman–Moreau envelopes and the Bregman proximity operators, and in
  the Langevin Monte Carlo algorithms reminiscent of mirror descent. The proposed
  algorithms extend existing Langevin Monte Carlo algorithms in two aspects—the ability
  to sample nonsmooth distributions with mirror descent-like algorithms, and the use
  of the more general Bregman–Moreau envelope in place of the Moreau envelope as a
  smooth approximation of the nonsmooth part of the potential. A particular case of
  the proposed scheme is reminiscent of the Bregman proximal gradient algorithm. The
  efficiency of the proposed methodology is illustrated with various sampling tasks
  at which existing Langevin Monte Carlo methods are known to perform poorly.
