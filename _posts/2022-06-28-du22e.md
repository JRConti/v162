title: SE(3) Equivariant Graph Neural Networks with Complete Local Frames
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Group equivariance (e.g. SE(3) equivariance) is a critical physical symmetry
  in science, from classical and quantum physics to computational biology. It enables
  robust and accurate prediction under arbitrary reference transformations. In light
  of this, great efforts have been put on encoding this symmetry into deep neural
  networks, which has been shown to improve the generalization performance and data
  efficiency for downstream tasks. Constructing an equivariant neural network generally
  brings high computational costs to ensure expressiveness. Therefore, how to better
  trade-off the expressiveness and computational efficiency plays a core role in the
  design of the equivariant deep learning models. In this paper, we propose a framework
  to construct SE(3) equivariant graph neural networks that can approximate the geometric
  quantities efficiently. Inspired by differential geometry and physics, we introduce
  equivariant local complete frames to graph neural networks, such that tensor information
  at given orders can be projected onto the frames. The local frame is constructed
  to form an orthonormal basis that avoids direction degeneration and ensure completeness.
  Since the frames are built only by cross product operations, our method is computationally
  efficient. We evaluate our method on two tasks: Newton mechanics modeling and equilibrium
  molecule conformation generation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that
  our model achieves the best or competitive performance in two types of datasets.'
