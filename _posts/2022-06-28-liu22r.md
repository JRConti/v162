abstract: 'An ideal strategy in zero-sum games should not only grant the player an
  average reward no less than the value of Nash equilibrium, but also exploit the
  (adaptive) opponents when they are suboptimal. While most existing works in Markov
  games focus exclusively on the former objective, it remains open whether we can
  achieve both objectives simultaneously. To address this problem, this work studies
  no-regret learning in Markov games with adversarial opponents when competing against
  the best fixed policy in hindsight. Along this direction, we present a new complete
  set of positive and negative results: When the policies of the opponents are revealed
  at the end of each episode, we propose new efficient algorithms achieving $\sqrt{K}$
  regret bounds when either (1) the baseline policy class is small or (2) the opponentâ€™s
  policy class is small. This is complemented with an exponential lower bound when
  neither conditions are true. When the policies of the opponents are not revealed,
  we prove a statistical hardness result even in the most favorable scenario when
  both above conditions are true. Our hardness result is much stronger than the existing
  hardness results which either only involve computational hardness, or require further
  restrictions on the algorithms.'
