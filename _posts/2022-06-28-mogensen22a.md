title: Invariant Ancestry Search
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Recently, methods have been proposed that exploit the invariance of prediction
  models with respect to changing environments to infer subsets of the causal parents
  of a response variable. If the environments influence only few of the underlying
  mechanisms, the subset identified by invariant causal prediction (ICP), for example,
  may be small, or even empty. We introduce the concept of minimal invariance and
  propose invariant ancestry search (IAS). In its population version, IAS outputs
  a set which contains only ancestors of the response and is a superset of the output
  of ICP. When applied to data, corresponding guarantees hold asymptotically if the
  underlying test for invariance has asymptotic level and power. We develop scalable
  algorithms and perform experiments on simulated and real data.
