title: 'RECAPP: Crafting a More Efficient Catalyst for Convex Optimization'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'The accelerated proximal point method (APPA), also known as "Catalyst",
  is a well-established reduction from convex optimization to approximate proximal
  point computation (i.e., regularized minimization). This reduction is conceptually
  elegant and yields strong convergence rate guarantees. However, these rates feature
  an extraneous logarithmic term arising from the need to compute each proximal point
  to high accuracy. In this work, we propose a novel Relaxed Error Criterion for Accelerated
  Proximal Point (RECAPP) that eliminates the need for high accuracy subproblem solutions.
  We apply RECAPP to two canonical problems: finite-sum and max-structured minimization.
  For finite-sum problems, we match the best known complexity, previously obtained
  by carefully-designed problem-specific algorithms. For minimizing max_y f(x,y) where
  f is convex in x and strongly-concave in y, we improve on the best known (Catalyst-based)
  bound by a logarithmic factor.'
