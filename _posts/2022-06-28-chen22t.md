title: Learning Mixtures of Linear Dynamical Systems
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We study the problem of learning a mixture of multiple linear dynamical
  systems (LDSs) from unlabeled short sample trajectories, each generated by one of
  the LDS models. Despite the wide applicability of mixture models for time-series
  data, learning algorithms that come with end-to-end performance guarantees are largely
  absent from existing literature. There are multiple sources of technical challenges,
  including but not limited to (1) the presence of latent variables (i.e. the unknown
  labels of trajectories); (2) the possibility that the sample trajectories might
  have lengths much smaller than the dimension $d$ of the LDS models; and (3) the
  complicated temporal dependence inherent to time-series data. To tackle these challenges,
  we develop a two-stage meta-algorithm, which is guaranteed to efficiently recover
  each ground-truth LDS model up to error $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{d/T})$, where $T$ is the
  total sample size. We validate our theoretical studies with numerical experiments,
  confirming the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.
