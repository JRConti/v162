title: A deep convolutional neural network that is invariant to time rescaling
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Human learners can readily understand speech, or a melody, when it is presented
  slower or faster than usual. This paper presents a deep CNN (SITHCon) that uses
  a logarithmically compressed temporal representation at each level. Because rescaling
  the time of the input results in a translation of $\log$ time, and because the output
  of the convolution is invariant to translations, this network can generalize to
  out-of-sample data that are temporal rescalings of a learned pattern. We compare
  the performance of SITHCon to a Temporal Convolution Network (TCN) on classification
  and regression problems with both univariate and multivariate time series. We find
  that SITHCon, unlike TCN, generalizes robustly over rescalings of about an order
  of magnitude. Moreover, we show that the network can generalize over exponentially
  large scales without retraining the weights simply by extending the range of the
  logarithmically-compressed temporal memory.
