title: Parametric Visual Program Induction with Function Modularization
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Generating programs to describe visual observations has gained much research
  attention recently. However, most of the existing approaches are based on non-parametric
  primitive functions, making them unable to handle complex visual scenes involving
  many attributes and details. In this paper, we propose the concept of parametric
  visual program induction. Learning to generate parametric programs for visual scenes
  is challenging due to the huge number of function variants and the complex function
  correlations. To solve these challenges, we propose the method of function modularization,
  capable of dealing with numerous function variants and complex correlations. Specifically,
  we model each parametric function as a multi-head self-contained neural module to
  cover different function variants. Moreover, to eliminate the complex correlations
  between functions, we propose the hierarchical heterogeneous Monto-Carlo tree search
  (H2MCTS) algorithm which can provide high-quality uncorrelated supervision during
  training, and serve as an efficient searching technique during testing. We demonstrate
  the superiority of the proposed method on three visual program induction datasets
  involving parametric primitive functions. Experimental results show that our proposed
  model is able to significantly outperform the state-of-the-art baseline methods
  in terms of generating accurate programs.
