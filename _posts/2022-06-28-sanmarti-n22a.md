title: The Algebraic Path Problem for Graph Metrics
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Finding paths with optimal properties is a foundational problem in computer
  science. The notions of shortest paths (minimal sum of edge costs), minimax paths
  (minimal maximum edge weight), reliability of a path and many others all arise as
  special cases of the "algebraic path problem" (APP). Indeed, the APP formalizes
  the relation between different semirings such as min-plus, min-max and the distances
  they induce. We here clarify, for the first time, the relation between the potential
  distance and the log-semiring. We also define a new unifying family of algebraic
  structures that include all above-mentioned path problems as well as the commute
  cost and others as special or limiting cases. The family comprises not only semirings
  but also strong bimonoids (that is, semirings without distributivity). We call this
  new and very general distance the "log-norm distance". Finally, we derive some sufficient
  conditions which ensure that the APP associated with a semiring defines a metric
  over an arbitrary graph.
