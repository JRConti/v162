title: 'HyperPrompt: Prompt-based Task-Conditioning of Transformers'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Prompt-Tuning is a new paradigm for finetuning pre-trained language models
  in a parameter efficient way. Here, we explore the use of HyperNetworks to generate
  hyper-prompts: we propose HyperPrompt, a novel architecture for prompt-based task-conditioning
  of self-attention in Transformers. The hyper-prompts are end-to-end learnable via
  generation by a HyperNetwork. HyperPrompt allows the network to learn task-specific
  feature maps where the hyper-prompts serve as task global memories for the queries
  to attend to, at the same time enabling flexible information sharing among tasks.
  We show that HyperPrompt is competitive against strong multi-task learning baselines
  with as few as 0.14% of additional task-conditioning parameters, achieving great
  parameter and computational efficiency. Through extensive empirical experiments,
  we demonstrate that HyperPrompt can achieve superior performances over strong T5
  multi-task learning baselines and parameter-efficient adapter variants including
  Prompt-Tuning and HyperFormer++ on Natural Language Understanding benchmarks of
  GLUE and SuperGLUE across many model sizes.'
