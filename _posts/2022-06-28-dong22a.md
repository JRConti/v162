title: Finding the Task-Optimal Low-Bit Sub-Distribution in Deep Neural Networks
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Quantized neural networks typically require smaller memory footprints and
  lower computation complexity, which is crucial for efficient deployment. However,
  quantization inevitably leads to a distribution divergence from the original network,
  which generally degrades the performance. To tackle this issue, massive efforts
  have been made, but most existing approaches lack statistical considerations and
  depend on several manual configurations. In this paper, we present an adaptive-mapping
  quantization method to learn an optimal latent sub-distribution that is inherent
  within models and smoothly approximated with a concrete Gaussian Mixture (GM). In
  particular, the network weights are projected in compliance with the GM-approximated
  sub-distribution. This sub-distribution evolves along with the weight update in
  a co-tuning schema guided by the direct task-objective optimization. Sufficient
  experiments on image classification and object detection over various modern architectures
  demonstrate the effectiveness, generalization property, and transferability of the
  proposed method. Besides, an efficient deployment flow for the mobile CPU is developed,
  achieving up to 7.46$\times$ inference acceleration on an octa-core ARM CPU. Our
  codes have been publicly released at https://github.com/RunpeiDong/DGMS.
