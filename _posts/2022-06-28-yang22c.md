title: A Psychological Theory of Explainability
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The goal of explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is to generate human-interpretable
  explanations, but there are no computationally precise theories of how humans interpret
  AI generated explanations. The lack of theory means that validation of XAI must
  be done empirically, on a case-by-case basis, which prevents systematic theory-building
  in XAI. We propose a psychological theory of how humans draw conclusions from saliency
  maps, the most common form of XAI explanation, which for the first time allows for
  precise prediction of explainee inference conditioned on explanation. Our theory
  posits that absent explanation humans expect the AI to make similar decisions to
  themselves, and that they interpret an explanation by comparison to the explanations
  they themselves would give. Comparison is formalized via Shepard’s universal law
  of generalization in a similarity space, a classic theory from cognitive science.
  A pre-registered user study on AI image classifications with saliency map explanations
  demonstrate that our theory quantitatively matches participants’ predictions of
  the AI.
