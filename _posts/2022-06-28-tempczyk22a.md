title: 'LIDL: Local Intrinsic Dimension Estimation Using Approximate Likelihood'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Most of the existing methods for estimating the local intrinsic dimension
  of a data distribution do not scale well to high dimensional data. Many of them
  rely on a non-parametric nearest neighbours approach which suffers from the curse
  of dimensionality. We attempt to address that challenge by proposing a novel approach
  to the problem: Local Intrinsic Dimension estimation using approximate Likelihood
  (LIDL). Our method relies on an arbitrary density estimation method as its subroutine,
  and hence tries to sidestep the dimensionality challenge by making use of the recent
  progress in parametric neural methods for likelihood estimation. We carefully investigate
  the empirical properties of the proposed method, compare them with our theoretical
  predictions, show that LIDL yields competitive results on the standard benchmarks
  for this problem, and that it scales to thousands of dimensions. What is more, we
  anticipate this approach to improve further with the continuing advances in the
  density estimation literature.'
