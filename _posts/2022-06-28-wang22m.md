title: Improved Certified Defenses against Data Poisoning with (Deterministic) Finite
  Aggregation
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Data poisoning attacks aim at manipulating model behaviors through distorting
  training data. Previously, an aggregation-based certified defense, Deep Partition
  Aggregation (DPA), was proposed to mitigate this threat. DPA predicts through an
  aggregation of base classifiers trained on disjoint subsets of data, thus restricting
  its sensitivity to dataset distortions. In this work, we propose an improved certified
  defense against general poisoning attacks, namely Finite Aggregation. In contrast
  to DPA, which directly splits the training set into disjoint subsets, our method
  first splits the training set into smaller disjoint subsets and then combines duplicates
  of them to build larger (but not disjoint) subsets for training base classifiers.
  This reduces the worst-case impacts of poison samples and thus improves certified
  robustness bounds. In addition, we offer an alternative view of our method, bridging
  the designs of deterministic and stochastic aggregation-based certified defenses.
  Empirically, our proposed Finite Aggregation consistently improves certificates
  on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and GTSRB, boosting certified fractions by up to 3.05%, 3.87%
  and 4.77%, respectively, while keeping the same clean accuracies as DPAâ€™s, effectively
  establishing a new state of the art in (pointwise) certified robustness against
  data poisoning.
