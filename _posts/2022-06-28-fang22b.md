title: Bayesian Continuous-Time Tucker Decomposition
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Tensor decomposition is a dominant framework for multiway data analysis
  and prediction. Although practical data often contains timestamps for the observed
  entries, existing tensor decomposition approaches overlook or under-use this valuable
  time information. They either drop the timestamps or bin them into crude steps and
  hence ignore the temporal dynamics within each step or use simple parametric time
  coefficients. To overcome these limitations, we propose Bayesian Continuous-Time
  Tucker Decomposition. We model the tensor-core of the classical Tucker decomposition
  as a time-varying function, and place a Gaussian process prior to flexibly estimate
  all kinds of temporal dynamics. In this way, our model maintains the interpretability
  while is flexible enough to capture various complex temporal relationships between
  the tensor nodes. For efficient and high-quality posterior inference, we use the
  stochastic differential equation (SDE) representation of temporal GPs to build an
  equivalent state-space prior, which avoids huge kernel matrix computation and sparse/low-rank
  approximations. We then use Kalman filtering, RTS smoothing, and conditional moment
  matching to develop a scalable message passing inference algorithm. We show the
  advantage of our method in simulation and several real-world applications.
