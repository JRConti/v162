title: Sparse Invariant Risk Minimization
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) is an emerging invariant feature extracting
  technique to help generalization with distributional shift. However, we find that
  there exists a basic and intractable contradiction between the model trainability
  and generalization ability in IRM. On one hand, recent studies on deep learning
  theory indicate the importance of large-sized or even overparameterized neural networks
  to make the model easy to train. On the other hand, unlike empirical risk minimization
  that can be benefited from overparameterization, our empirical and theoretical analyses
  show that the generalization ability of IRM is much easier to be demolished by overfitting
  caused by overparameterization. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective
  paradigm named Sparse Invariant Risk Minimization (SparseIRM) to address this contradiction.
  Our key idea is to employ a global sparsity constraint as a defense to prevent spurious
  features from leaking in during the whole IRM process. Compared with sparisfy-after-training
  prototype by prior work which can discard invariant features, the global sparsity
  constraint limits the budget for feature selection and enforces SparseIRM to select
  the invariant features. We illustrate the benefit of SparseIRM through a theoretical
  analysis on a simple linear case. Empirically we demonstrate the power of SparseIRM
  through various datasets and models and surpass state-of-the-art methods with a
  gap up to 29%.
