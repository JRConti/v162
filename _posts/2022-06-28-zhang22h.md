title: Examining Scaling and Transfer of Language Model Architectures for Machine
  Translation
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Natural language understanding and generation models follow one of the
  two dominant architectural paradigms: language models (LMs) that process concatenated
  sequences in a single stack of layers, and encoder-decoder models (EncDec) that
  utilize separate layer stacks for input and output processing. In machine translation,
  EncDec has long been the favoured approach, but with few studies investigating the
  performance of LMs. In this work, we thoroughly examine the role of several architectural
  design choices on the performance of LMs on bilingual, (massively) multilingual
  and zero-shot translation tasks, under systematic variations of data conditions
  and model sizes. Our results show that: (i) Different LMs have different scaling
  properties, where architectural differences often have a significant impact on model
  performance at small scales, but the performance gap narrows as the number of parameters
  increases, (ii) Several design choices, including causal masking and language-modeling
  objectives for the source sequence, have detrimental effects on translation quality,
  and (iii) When paired with full-visible masking for source sequences, LMs could
  perform on par with EncDec on supervised bilingual and multilingual translation
  tasks, and improve greatly on zero-shot directions by facilitating the reduction
  of off-target translations.'
