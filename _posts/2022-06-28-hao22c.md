title: 'GSmooth: Certified Robustness against Semantic Transformations via Generalized
  Randomized Smoothing'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Certified defenses such as randomized smoothing have shown promise towards
  building reliable machine learning systems against $\ell_p$ norm bounded attacks.
  However, existing methods are insufficient or unable to provably defend against
  semantic transformations, especially those without closed-form expressions (such
  as defocus blur and pixelate), which are more common in practice and often unrestricted.
  To fill up this gap, we propose generalized randomized smoothing (GSmooth), a unified
  theoretical framework for certifying robustness against general semantic transformations
  via a novel dimension augmentation strategy. Under the GSmooth framework, we present
  a scalable algorithm that uses a surrogate image-to-image network to approximate
  the complex transformation. The surrogate model provides a powerful tool for studying
  the properties of semantic transformations and certifying robustness. Experimental
  results on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for robustness
  certification against multiple kinds of semantic transformations and corruptions,
  which is not achievable by the alternative baselines.
