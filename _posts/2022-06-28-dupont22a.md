title: 'From data to functa: Your data point is a function and you can treat it like
  one'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'It is common practice in deep learning to represent a measurement of the
  world on a discrete grid, e.g. a 2D grid of pixels. However, the underlying signal
  represented by these measurements is often continuous, e.g. the scene depicted in
  an image. A powerful continuous alternative is then to represent these measurements
  using an <em>implicit neural representation</em>, a neural function trained to output
  the appropriate measurement value for any input spatial location. In this paper,
  we take this idea to its next level: what would it take to perform deep learning
  on these functions instead, treating them as data? In this context we refer to the
  data as <em>functa</em>, and propose a framework for deep learning on functa. This
  view presents a number of challenges around efficient conversion from data to functa,
  compact representation of functa, and effectively solving downstream tasks on functa.
  We outline a recipe to overcome these challenges and apply it to a wide range of
  data modalities including images, 3D shapes, neural radiance fields (NeRF) and data
  on manifolds. We demonstrate that this approach has various compelling properties
  across data modalities, in particular on the canonical tasks of generative modeling,
  data imputation, novel view synthesis and classification.'
