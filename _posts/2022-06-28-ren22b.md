title: Towards Theoretical Analysis of Transformation Complexity of ReLU DNNs
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: This paper aims to theoretically analyze the complexity of feature transformations
  encoded in piecewise linear DNNs with ReLU layers. We propose metrics to measure
  three types of complexities of transformations based on the information theory.
  We further discover and prove the strong correlation between the complexity and
  the disentanglement of transformations. Based on the proposed metrics, we analyze
  two typical phenomena of the change of the transformation complexity during the
  training process, and explore the ceiling of a DNNâ€™s complexity. The proposed metrics
  can also be used as a loss to learn a DNN with the minimum complexity, which also
  controls the over-fitting level of the DNN and influences adversarial robustness,
  adversarial transferability, and knowledge consistency. Comprehensive comparative
  studies have provided new perspectives to understand the DNN. The code is released
  at https://github.com/sjtu-XAI-lab/transformation-complexity.
