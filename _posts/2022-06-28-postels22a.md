title: On the Practicality of Deterministic Epistemic Uncertainty
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: A set of novel approaches for estimating epistemic uncertainty in deep neural
  networks with a single forward pass has recently emerged as a valid alternative
  to Bayesian Neural Networks. On the premise of informative representations, these
  deterministic uncertainty methods (DUMs) achieve strong performance on detecting
  out-of-distribution (OOD) data while adding negligible computational costs at inference
  time. However, it remains unclear whether DUMs are well calibrated and can seamlessly
  scale to real-world applications - both prerequisites for their practical deployment.
  To this end, we first provide a taxonomy of DUMs, and evaluate their calibration
  under continuous distributional shifts. Then, we extend them to semantic segmentation.
  We find that, while DUMs scale to realistic vision tasks and perform well on OOD
  detection, the practicality of current methods is undermined by poor calibration
  under distributional shifts.
