abstract: As a seminal tool in self-supervised representation learning, contrastive
  learning has gained unprecedented attention in recent years. In essence, contrastive
  learning aims to leverage pairs of positive and negative samples for representation
  learning, which relates to exploiting neighborhood information in a feature space.
  By investigating the connection between contrastive learning and neighborhood component
  analysis (NCA), we provide a novel stochastic nearest neighbor viewpoint of contrastive
  learning and subsequently propose a series of contrastive losses that outperform
  the existing ones. Under our proposed framework, we show a new methodology to design
  integrated contrastive losses that could simultaneously achieve good accuracy and
  robustness on downstream tasks. With the integrated framework, we achieve up to
  6% improvement on the standard accuracy and 17% improvement on the robust accuracy.
