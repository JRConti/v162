title: Linear-Time Gromov Wasserstein Distances using Low Rank Couplings and Costs
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'The ability to align points across two related yet incomparable point clouds
  (e.g. living in different spaces) plays an important role in machine learning. The
  Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) framework provides an increasingly popular answer to such
  problems, by seeking a low-distortion, geometry-preserving assignment between these
  points. As a non-convex, quadratic generalization of optimal transport (OT), GW
  is NP-hard. While practitioners often resort to solving GW approximately as a nested
  sequence of entropy-regularized OT problems, the cubic complexity (in the number
  $n$ of samples) of that approach is a roadblock. We show in this work how a recent
  variant of the OT problem that restricts the set of admissible couplings to those
  having a low-rank factorization is remarkably well suited to the resolution of GW:
  when applied to GW, we show that this approach is not only able to compute a stationary
  point of the GW problem in time $O(n^2)$, but also uniquely positioned to benefit
  from the knowledge that the initial cost matrices are low-rank, to yield a linear
  time $O(n)$ GW approximation. Our approach yields similar results, yet orders of
  magnitude faster computation than the SoTA entropic GW approaches, on both simulated
  and real data.'
