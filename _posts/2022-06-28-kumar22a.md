title: 'ActiveHedge: Hedge meets Active Learning'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We consider the classical problem of multi-class prediction with expert
  advice, but with an active learning twist. In this new setting the learner will
  only query the labels of a small number of examples, but still aims to minimize
  regret to the best expert as usual; the learner is also allowed a very short "burn-in"
  phase where it can fast-forward and query certain highly-informative examples. We
  design an algorithm that utilizes Hedge (aka Exponential Weights) as a subroutine,
  and we show that under a very particular combinatorial constraint on the matrix
  of expert predictions we can obtain a very strong regret guarantee while querying
  very few labels. This constraint, which we refer to as $\zeta$-compactness, or just
  compactness, can be viewed as a non-stochastic variant of the disagreement coefficient,
  another popular parameter used to reason about the sample complexity of active learning
  in the IID setting. We also give a polynomial-time algorithm to calculate the $\zeta$-compactness
  of a matrix up to an approximation factor of 3.
