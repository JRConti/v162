title: 'FOCUS: Familiar Objects in Common and Uncommon Settings'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Standard training datasets for deep learning often do not contain objects
  in uncommon and rare settings (e.g., “a plane on water”, “a car in snowy weather”).
  This can cause models trained on these datasets to incorrectly predict objects that
  are typical for the context in the image, rather than identifying the objects that
  are actually present. In this paper, we introduce FOCUS (Familiar Objects in Common
  and Uncommon Settings), a dataset for stress-testing the generalization power of
  deep image classifiers. By leveraging the power of modern search engines, we deliberately
  gather data containing objects in common and uncommon settings; in a wide range
  of locations, weather conditions, and time of day. We present a detailed analysis
  of the performance of various popular image classifiers on our dataset and demonstrate
  a clear drop in accuracy when classifying images in uncommon settings. We also show
  that finetuning a model on our dataset drastically improves its ability to focus
  on the object of interest leading to better generalization. Lastly, we leverage
  FOCUS to machine annotate additional visual attributes for the entirety of ImageNet.
  We believe that our dataset will aid researchers in understanding the inability
  of deep models to generalize well to uncommon settings and drive future work on
  improving their distributional robustness.
