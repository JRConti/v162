title: Low-Precision Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: While low-precision optimization has been widely used to accelerate deep
  learning, low-precision sampling remains largely unexplored. As a consequence, sampling
  is simply infeasible in many large-scale scenarios, despite providing remarkable
  benefits to generalization and uncertainty estimation for neural networks. In this
  paper, we provide the first study of low-precision Stochastic Gradient Langevin
  Dynamics (SGLD), showing that its costs can be significantly reduced without sacrificing
  performance, due to its intrinsic ability to handle system noise. We prove that
  the convergence of low-precision SGLD with full-precision gradient accumulators
  is less affected by the quantization error than its SGD counterpart in the strongly
  convex setting. To further enable low-precision gradient accumulators, we develop
  a new quantization function for SGLD that preserves the variance in each update
  step. We demonstrate that low-precision SGLD achieves comparable performance to
  full-precision SGLD with only 8 bits on a variety of deep learning tasks.
