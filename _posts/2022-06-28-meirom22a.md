title: Optimizing Tensor Network Contraction Using Reinforcement Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Quantum Computing (QC) stands to revolutionize computing, but is currently
  still limited. To develop and test quantum algorithms today, quantum circuits are
  often simulated on classical computers. Simulating a complex quantum circuit requires
  computing the contraction of a large network of tensors. The order (path) of contraction
  can have a drastic effect on the computing cost, but finding an efficient order
  is a challenging combinatorial optimization problem. We propose a Reinforcement
  Learning (RL) approach combined with Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to address the
  contraction ordering problem. The problem is extremely challenging due to the huge
  search space, the heavy-tailed reward distribution, and the challenging credit assignment.
  We show how a carefully implemented RL-agent that uses a GNN as the basic policy
  construct can address these challenges and obtain significant improvements over
  state-of-the-art techniques in three varieties of circuits, including the largest
  scale networks used in contemporary QC.
