title: Hindering Adversarial Attacks with Implicit Neural Representations
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We introduce the Lossy Implicit Network Activation Coding (LINAC) defence,
  an input transformation which successfully hinders several common adversarial attacks
  on CIFAR-10 classifiers for perturbations up to 8/255 in Linf norm and 0.5 in L2
  norm. Implicit neural representations are used to approximately encode pixel colour
  intensities in 2D images such that classifiers trained on transformed data appear
  to have robustness to small perturbations without adversarial training or large
  drops in performance. The seed of the random number generator used to initialise
  and train the implicit neural representation turns out to be necessary information
  for stronger generic attacks, suggesting its role as a private key. We devise a
  Parametric Bypass Approximation (PBA) attack strategy for key-based defences, which
  successfully invalidates an existing method in this category. Interestingly, our
  LINAC defence also hinders some transfer and adaptive attacks, including our novel
  PBA strategy. Our results emphasise the importance of a broad range of customised
  attacks despite apparent robustness according to standard evaluations.
