title: 'DNS: Determinantal Point Process Based Neural Network Sampler for Ensemble
  Reinforcement Learning'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'The application of an ensemble of neural networks is becoming an imminent
  tool for advancing state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms. However,
  training these large numbers of neural networks in the ensemble has an exceedingly
  high computation cost which may become a hindrance in training large-scale systems.
  In this paper, we propose DNS: a Determinantal Point Process based Neural Network
  Sampler that specifically uses k-DPP to sample a subset of neural networks for backpropagation
  at every training step thus significantly reducing the training time and computation
  cost. We integrated DNS in REDQ for continuous control tasks and evaluated on MuJoCo
  environments. Our experiments show that DNS augmented REDQ matches the baseline
  REDQ in terms of average cumulative reward and achieves this using less than 50%
  computation when measured in FLOPS. The code is available at https://github.com/IntelLabs/DNS'
