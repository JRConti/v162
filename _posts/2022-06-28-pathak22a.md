title: A new similarity measure for covariate shift with applications to nonparametric
  regression
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We study covariate shift in the context of nonparametric regression. We
  introduce a new measure of distribution mismatch between the source and target distributions
  using the integrated ratio of probabilities of balls at a given radius. We use the
  scaling of this measure with respect to the radius to characterize the minimax rate
  of estimation over a family of H{รถ}lder continuous functions under covariate shift.
  In comparison to the recently proposed notion of transfer exponent, this measure
  leads to a sharper rate of convergence and is more fine-grained. We accompany our
  theory with concrete instances of covariate shift that illustrate this sharp difference.
