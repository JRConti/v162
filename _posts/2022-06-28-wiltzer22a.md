  Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Continuous-time reinforcement learning offers an appealing formalism for
  describing control problems in which the passage of time is not naturally divided
  into discrete increments. Here we consider the problem of predicting the distribution
  of returns obtained by an agent interacting in a continuous-time, stochastic environment.
  Accurate return predictions have proven useful for determining optimal policies
  for risk-sensitive control, learning state representations, multiagent coordination,
  and more. We begin by establishing the distributional analogue of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman
  (HJB) equation for Ito diffusions and the broader class of Feller-Dynkin processes.
  We then specialize this equation to the setting in which the return distribution
  is approximated by N uniformly-weighted particles, a common design choice in distributional
  algorithms. Our derivation highlights additional terms due to statistical diffusivity
  which arise from the proper handling of distributions in the continuous-time setting.
  Based on this, we propose a tractable algorithm for approximately solving the distributional
  HJB based on a JKO scheme, which can be implemented in an online, control algorithm.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of such an algorithm in a synthetic control problem.
