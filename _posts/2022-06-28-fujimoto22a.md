title: Why Should I Trust You, Bellman? The Bellman Error is a Poor Replacement for
  Value Error
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In this work, we study the use of the Bellman equation as a surrogate objective
  for value prediction accuracy. While the Bellman equation is uniquely solved by
  the true value function over all state-action pairs, we find that the Bellman error
  (the difference between both sides of the equation) is a poor proxy for the accuracy
  of the value function. In particular, we show that (1) due to cancellations from
  both sides of the Bellman equation, the magnitude of the Bellman error is only weakly
  related to the distance to the true value function, even when considering all state-action
  pairs, and (2) in the finite data regime, the Bellman equation can be satisfied
  exactly by infinitely many suboptimal solutions. This means that the Bellman error
  can be minimized without improving the accuracy of the value function. We demonstrate
  these phenomena through a series of propositions, illustrative toy examples, and
  empirical analysis in standard benchmark domains.
