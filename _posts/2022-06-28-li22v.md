title: Let Invariant Rationale Discovery Inspire Graph Contrastive Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Leading graph contrastive learning (GCL) methods perform graph augmentations
  in two fashions: (1) randomly corrupting the anchor graph, which could cause the
  loss of semantic information, or (2) using domain knowledge to maintain salient
  features, which undermines the generalization to other domains. Taking an invariance
  look at GCL, we argue that a high-performing augmentation should preserve the salient
  semantics of anchor graphs regarding instance-discrimination. To this end, we relate
  GCL with invariant rationale discovery, and propose a new framework, Rationale-aware
  Graph Contrastive Learning (RGCL). Specifically, without supervision signals, RGCL
  uses a rationale generator to reveal salient features about graph instance-discrimination
  as the rationale, and then creates rationale-aware views for contrastive learning.
  This rationale-aware pre-training scheme endows the backbone model with the powerful
  representation ability, further facilitating the fine-tuning on downstream tasks.
  On MNIST-Superpixel and MUTAG datasets, visual inspections on the discovered rationales
  showcase that the rationale generator successfully captures the salient features
  (\ie distinguishing semantic nodes in graphs). On biochemical molecule and social
  network benchmark datasets, the state-of-the-art performance of RGCL demonstrates
  the effectiveness of rationale-aware views for contrastive learning. Our codes are
  available at https://github.com/lsh0520/RGCL.'
