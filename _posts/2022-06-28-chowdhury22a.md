title: Shuffle Private Linear Contextual Bandits
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Differential privacy (DP) has been recently introduced to linear contextual
  bandits to formally address the privacy concerns in its associated personalized
  services to participating users (e.g., recommendations). Prior work largely focus
  on two trust models of DP – the central model, where a central server is responsible
  for protecting users’ sensitive data, and the (stronger) local model, where information
  needs to be protected directly on users’ side. However, there remains a fundamental
  gap in the utility achieved by learning algorithms under these two privacy models,
  e.g., if all users are <em>unique</em> within a learning horizon $T$, $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$
  regret in the central model as compared to $\widetilde{O}(T^{3/4})$ regret in the
  local model. In this work, we aim to achieve a stronger model of trust than the
  central model, while suffering a smaller regret than the local model by considering
  recently popular <em>shuffle</em> model of privacy. We propose a general algorithmic
  framework for linear contextual bandits under the shuffle trust model, where there
  exists a trusted shuffler – in between users and the central server– that randomly
  permutes a batch of users data before sending those to the server. We then instantiate
  this framework with two specific shuffle protocols – one relying on privacy amplification
  of local mechanisms, and another incorporating a protocol for summing vectors and
  matrices of bounded norms. We prove that both these instantiations lead to regret
  guarantees that significantly improve on that of the local model, and can potentially
  be of the order $\widetilde{O}(T^{3/5})$ if all users are unique. We also verify
  this regret behavior with simulations on synthetic data. Finally, under the practical
  scenario of non-unique users, we show that the regret of our shuffle private algorithm
  scale as $\widetilde{O}(T^{2/3})$, which <em>matches</em> what the central model
  could achieve in this case.
