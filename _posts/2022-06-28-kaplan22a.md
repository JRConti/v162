title: Differentially Private Approximate Quantiles
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In this work we study the problem of differentially private (DP) quantiles,
  in which given dataset $X$ and quantiles $q_1, ..., q_m \in [0,1]$, we want to output
  $m$ quantile estimations which are as close as possible to the true quantiles and
  preserve DP. We describe a simple recursive DP algorithm, which we call Approximate
  Quantiles (AQ), for this task. We give a worst case upper bound on its error, and
  show that its error is much lower than of previous implementations on several different
  datasets. Furthermore, it gets this low error while running time two orders of magnitude
  faster that the best previous implementation.
