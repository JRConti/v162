title: Variational Inference for Infinitely Deep Neural Networks
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'We introduce the unbounded depth neural network (UDN), an infinitely deep
  probabilistic model that adapts its complexity to the training data. The UDN contains
  an infinite sequence of hidden layers and places an unbounded prior on a truncation
  L, the layer from which it produces its data. Given a dataset of observations, the
  posterior UDN provides a conditional distribution of both the parameters of the
  infinite neural network and its truncation. We develop a novel variational inference
  algorithm to approximate this posterior, optimizing a distribution of the neural
  network weights and of the truncation depth L, and without any upper limit on L.
  To this end, the variational family has a special structure: it models neural network
  weights of arbitrary depth, and it dynamically creates or removes free variational
  parameters as its distribution of the truncation is optimized. (Unlike heuristic
  approaches to model search, it is solely through gradient-based optimization that
  this algorithm explores the space of truncations.) We study the UDN on real and
  synthetic data. We find that the UDN adapts its posterior depth to the dataset complexity;
  it outperforms standard neural networks of similar computational complexity; and
  it outperforms other approaches to infinite-depth neural networks.'
