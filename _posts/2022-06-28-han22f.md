title: Adversarial Attacks on Gaussian Process Bandits
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Gaussian processes (GP) are a widely-adopted tool used to sequentially optimize
  black-box functions, where evaluations are costly and potentially noisy. Recent
  works on GP bandits have proposed to move beyond random noise and devise algorithms
  robust to adversarial attacks. This paper studies this problem from the attacker’s
  perspective, proposing various adversarial attack methods with differing assumptions
  on the attacker’s strength and prior information. Our goal is to understand adversarial
  attacks on GP bandits from theoretical and practical perspectives. We focus primarily
  on targeted attacks on the popular GP-UCB algorithm and a related elimination-based
  algorithm, based on adversarially perturbing the function f to produce another function
  f  whose optima are in some target region. Based on our theoretical analysis, we
  devise both white-box attacks (known f) and black-box attacks (unknown f), with
  the former including a Subtraction attack and Clipping attack, and the latter including
  an Aggressive subtraction attack. We demonstrate that adversarial attacks on GP
  bandits can succeed in forcing the algorithm towards the target region even with
  a low attack budget, and we test our attacks’ effectiveness on a diverse range of
  objective functions.
