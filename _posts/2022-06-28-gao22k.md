title: Learning to Incorporate Texture Saliency Adaptive Attention to Image Cartoonization
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Image cartoonization is recently dominated by generative adversarial networks
  (GANs) from the perspective of unsupervised image-to-image translation, in which
  an inherent challenge is to precisely capture and sufficiently transfer characteristic
  cartoon styles (e.g., clear edges, smooth color shading, vivid colors, etc.). Existing
  advanced models try to enhance cartoonization effect by learning to promote edges
  adversarially, introducing style transfer loss, or learning to align style from
  multiple representation space. This paper demonstrates that more distinct and vivid
  cartoonization effect could be easily achieved with only basic adversarial loss.
  Observing that cartoon style is more evident in cartoon-texture-salient local image
  regions, we build a region-level adversarial learning branch in parallel with the
  normal image-level one, which constrains adversarial learning on cartoon-texture-salient
  local patches for better perceiving and transferring cartoon texture features. To
  this end, a novel cartoon-texture-saliency-sampler (CTSS) module is proposed to
  adaptively sample cartoon-texture-salient patches from training data. We present
  that such texture saliency adaptive attention is of significant importance in facilitating
  and enhancing cartoon stylization, which is a key missing ingredient of related
  methods. The superiority of our model in promoting cartoonization effect, especially
  for high-resolution input images, are fully demonstrated with extensive experiments.
