title: 'Coarsening the Granularity: Towards Structurally Sparse Lottery Tickets'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'The lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH) has shown that dense models contain
  highly sparse subnetworks (i.e., winning tickets) that can be trained in isolation
  to match full accuracy. Despite many exciting efforts being made, there is one "commonsense"
  rarely challenged: a winning ticket is found by iterative magnitude pruning (IMP)
  and hence the resultant pruned subnetworks have only unstructured sparsity. That
  gap limits the appeal of winning tickets in practice, since the highly irregular
  sparse patterns are challenging to accelerate on hardware. Meanwhile, directly substituting
  structured pruning for unstructured pruning in IMP damages performance more severely
  and is usually unable to locate winning tickets. In this paper, we demonstrate the
  first positive result that a structurally sparse winning ticket can be effectively
  found in general. The core idea is to append "post-processing techniques" after
  each round of (unstructured) IMP, to enforce the formation of structural sparsity.
  Specifically, we first "re-fill" pruned elements back in some channels deemed to
  be important, and then "re-group" non-zero elements to create flexible group-wise
  structural patterns. Both our identified channel- and group-wise structural subnetworks
  win the lottery, with substantial inference speedups readily supported by existing
  hardware. Extensive experiments, conducted on diverse datasets across multiple network
  backbones, consistently validate our proposal, showing that the hardware acceleration
  roadblock of LTH is now removed. Specifically, the structural winning tickets obtain
  up to {64.93%, 64.84%, 60.23%} running time savings at {36%Â 80%, 74%, 58%} sparsity
  on {CIFAR, Tiny-ImageNet, ImageNet}, while maintaining comparable accuracy. Code
