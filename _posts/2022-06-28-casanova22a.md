  for Everyone'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: YourTTS brings the power of a multilingual approach to the task of zero-shot
  multi-speaker TTS. Our method builds upon the VITS model and adds several novel
  modifications for zero-shot multi-speaker and multilingual training. We achieved
  state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in zero-shot multi-speaker TTS and results comparable
  to SOTA in zero-shot voice conversion on the VCTK dataset. Additionally, our approach
  achieves promising results in a target language with a single-speaker dataset, opening
  possibilities for zero-shot multi-speaker TTS and zero-shot voice conversion systems
  in low-resource languages. Finally, it is possible to fine-tune the YourTTS model
  with less than 1 minute of speech and achieve state-of-the-art results in voice
  similarity and with reasonable quality. This is important to allow synthesis for
  speakers with a very different voice or recording characteristics from those seen
  during training.
