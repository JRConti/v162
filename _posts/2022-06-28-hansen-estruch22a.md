title: Bisimulation Makes Analogies in Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Building generalizable goal-conditioned agents from rich observations is
  a key to reinforcement learning (RL) solving real world problems. Traditionally
  in goal-conditioned RL, an agent is provided with the exact goal they intend to
  reach. However, it is often not realistic to know the configuration of the goal
  before performing a task. A more scalable framework would allow us to provide the
  agent with an example of an analogous task, and have the agent then infer what the
  goal should be for its current state. We propose a new form of state abstraction
  called goal-conditioned bisimulation that captures functional equivariance, allowing
  for the reuse of skills to achieve new goals. We learn this representation using
  a metric form of this abstraction, and show its ability to generalize to new goals
  in real world manipulation tasks. Further, we prove that this learned representation
  is sufficient not only for goal-conditioned tasks, but is amenable to any downstream
  task described by a state-only reward function.
