title: Conformal Prediction Sets with Limited False Positives
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We develop a new approach to multi-label conformal prediction in which we
  aim to output a precise set of promising prediction candidates with a bounded number
  of incorrect answers. Standard conformal prediction provides the ability to adapt
  to model uncertainty by constructing a calibrated candidate set in place of a single
  prediction, with guarantees that the set contains the correct answer with high probability.
  In order to obey this coverage property, however, conformal sets can become inundated
  with noisy candidatesâ€”which can render them unhelpful in practice. This is particularly
  relevant to practical applications where there is a limited budget, and the cost
  (monetary or otherwise) associated with false positives is non-negligible. We propose
  to trade coverage for a notion of precision by enforcing that the presence of incorrect
  candidates in the predicted conformal sets (i.e., the total number of false positives)
  is bounded according to a user-specified tolerance. Subject to this constraint,
  our algorithm then optimizes for a generalized notion of set coverage (i.e., the
  true positive rate) that allows for any number of true answers for a given query
  (including zero). We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across a number
  of classification tasks in natural language processing, computer vision, and computational
  chemistry.
