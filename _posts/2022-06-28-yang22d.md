title: Omni-Granular Ego-Semantic Propagation for Self-Supervised Graph Representation
  Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Unsupervised/self-supervised graph representation learning is critical for
  downstream node- and graph-level classification tasks. Global structure of graphs
  helps discriminating representations and existing methods mainly utilize the global
  structure by imposing additional supervisions. However, their global semantics are
  usually invariant for all nodes/graphs and they fail to explicitly embed the global
  semantics to enrich the representations. In this paper, we propose Omni-Granular
  Ego-Semantic Propagation for Self-Supervised Graph Representation Learning (OEPG).
  Specifically, we introduce instance-adaptive global-aware ego-semantic descriptors,
  leveraging the first- and second-order feature differences between each node/graph
  and hierarchical global clusters of the entire graph dataset. The descriptors can
  be explicitly integrated into local graph convolution as new neighbor nodes. Besides,
  we design an omni-granular normalization on the whole scales and hierarchies of
  the ego-semantic to assign attentional weight to each descriptor from an omni-granular
  perspective. Specialized pretext tasks and cross-iteration momentum update are further
  developed for local-global mutual adaptation. In downstream tasks, OEPG consistently
  achieves the best performance with a 2%~6% accuracy gain on multiple datasets cross
  scales and domains. Notably, OEPG also generalizes to quantity- and topology-imbalance
  scenarios.
