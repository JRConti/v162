title: The Poisson Binomial Mechanism for Unbiased Federated Learning with Secure
  Aggregation
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We introduce the Poisson Binomial mechanism (PBM), a discrete differential
  privacy mechanism for distributed mean estimation (DME) with applications to federated
  learning and analytics. We provide a tight analysis of its privacy guarantees, showing
  that it achieves the same privacy-accuracy trade-offs as the continuous Gaussian
  mechanism. Our analysis is based on a novel bound on the RÃ©nyi divergence of two
  Poisson binomial distributions that may be of independent interest. Unlike previous
  discrete DP schemes based on additive noise, our mechanism encodes local information
  into a parameter of the binomial distribution, and hence the output distribution
  is discrete with bounded support. Moreover, the support does not increase as the
  privacy budget goes to zero as in the case of additive schemes which require the
  addition of more noise to achieve higher privacy; on the contrary, the support becomes
  smaller as eps goes to zero. The bounded support enables us to combine our mechanism
  with secure aggregation (SecAgg), a multi-party cryptographic protocol, without
  the need of performing modular clipping which results in an unbiased estimator of
  the sum of the local vectors. This in turn allows us to apply it in the private
  FL setting and provide an upper bound on the convergence rate of the SGD algorithm.
  Moreover, since the support of the output distribution becomes smaller as $\varepsilon
  \ra 0$, the communication cost of our scheme decreases with the privacy constraint
  $\varepsilon$, outperforming all previous distributed DP schemes based on additive
  noise in the high privacy or low communication regimes.
