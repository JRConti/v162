title: Interactive Correlation Clustering with Existential Cluster Constraints
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'We consider the problem of clustering with user feedback. Existing methods
  express constraints about the input data points, most commonly through must-link
  and cannot-link constraints on data point pairs. In this paper, we introduce existential
  cluster constraints: a new form of feedback where users indicate the features of
  desired clusters. Specifically, users make statements about the existence of a cluster
  having (and not having) particular features. Our approach has multiple advantages:
  (1) constraints on clusters can express user intent more efficiently than point
  pairs; (2) in cases where the usersâ€™ mental model is of the desired clusters, it
  is more natural for users to express cluster-wise preferences; (3) it functions
  even when privacy restrictions prohibit users from seeing raw data. In addition
  to introducing existential cluster constraints, we provide an inference algorithm
  for incorporating our constraints into the output clustering. Finally, we demonstrate
  empirically that our proposed framework facilitates more accurate clustering with
  dramatically fewer user feedback inputs.'
