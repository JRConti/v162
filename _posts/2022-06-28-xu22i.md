title: On the Statistical Benefits of Curriculum Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Curriculum learning (CL) is a commonly used machine learning training strategy.
  However, we still lack a clear theoretical understanding of CLâ€™s benefits. In this
  paper, we study the benefits of CL in the multitask linear regression problem under
  both structured and unstructured settings. For both settings, we derive the minimax
  rates for CL with the oracle that provides the optimal curriculum and without the
  oracle, where the agent has to adaptively learn a good curriculum. Our results reveal
  that adaptive learning can be fundamentally harder than the oracle learning in the
  unstructured setting, but it merely introduces a small extra term in the structured
  setting. To connect theory with practice, we provide justification for a popular
  empirical method that selects tasks with highest local prediction gain by comparing
  its guarantees with the minimax rates mentioned above.
