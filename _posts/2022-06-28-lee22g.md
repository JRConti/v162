title: 'Maslow’s Hammer in Catastrophic Forgetting: Node Re-Use vs. Node Activation'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Continual learning—learning new tasks in sequence while maintaining performance
  on old tasks—remains particularly challenging for artificial neural networks. Surprisingly,
  the amount of forgetting does not increase with the dissimilarity between the learned
  tasks, but appears to be worst in an intermediate similarity regime. In this paper
  we theoretically analyse both a synthetic teacher-student framework and a real data
  setup to provide an explanation of this phenomenon that we name Maslow’s Hammer
  hypothesis. Our analysis reveals the presence of a trade-off between node activation
  and node re-use that results in worst forgetting in the intermediate regime. Using
  this understanding we reinterpret popular algorithmic interventions for catastrophic
  interference in terms of this trade-off, and identify the regimes in which they
  are most effective.
