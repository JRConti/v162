title: 'AutoSNN: Towards Energy-Efficient Spiking Neural Networks'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) that mimic information transmission in the
  brain can energy-efficiently process spatio-temporal information through discrete
  and sparse spikes, thereby receiving considerable attention. To improve accuracy
  and energy efficiency of SNNs, most previous studies have focused solely on training
  methods, and the effect of architecture has rarely been studied. We investigate
  the design choices used in the previous studies in terms of the accuracy and number
  of spikes and figure out that they are not best-suited for SNNs. To further improve
  the accuracy and reduce the spikes generated by SNNs, we propose a spike-aware neural
  architecture search framework called AutoSNN. We define a search space consisting
  of architectures without undesirable design choices. To enable the spike-aware architecture
  search, we introduce a fitness that considers both the accuracy and number of spikes.
  AutoSNN successfully searches for SNN architectures that outperform hand-crafted
  SNNs in accuracy and energy efficiency. We thoroughly demonstrate the effectiveness
  of AutoSNN on various datasets including neuromorphic datasets.
