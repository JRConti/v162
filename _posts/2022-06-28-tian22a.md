title: On the Finite-Time Complexity and Practical Computation of Approximate Stationarity
  Concepts of Lipschitz Functions
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We report a practical finite-time algorithmic scheme to compute approximately
  stationary points for nonconvex nonsmooth Lipschitz functions. In particular, we
  are interested in two kinds of approximate stationarity notions for nonconvex nonsmooth
  problems, i.e., Goldstein approximate stationarity (GAS) and near-approximate stationarity
  (NAS). For GAS, our scheme removes the unrealistic subgradient selection oracle
  assumption in (Zhang et al., 2020, Assumption 1) and computes GAS with the same
  finite-time complexity. For NAS, Davis & Drusvyatskiy (2019) showed that $\rho$-weakly
  convex functions admit finite-time computation, while Tian & So (2021) provided
  the matching impossibility results of dimension-free finite-time complexity for
  first-order methods. Complement to these developments, in this paper, we isolate
  a new class of functions that could be Clarke irregular (and thus not weakly convex
  anymore) and show that our new algorithmic scheme can compute NAS points for functions
  in that class within finite time. To demonstrate the wide applicability of our new
  theoretical framework, we show that $\rho$-margin SVM, $1$-layer, and $2$-layer
  ReLU neural networks, all being Clarke irregular, satisfy our new conditions.
