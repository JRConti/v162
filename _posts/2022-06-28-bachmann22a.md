title: How Tempering Fixes Data Augmentation in Bayesian Neural Networks
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: While Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) provide a sound and principled alternative
  to standard neural networks, an artificial sharpening of the posterior usually needs
  to be applied to reach comparable performance. This is in stark contrast to theory,
  dictating that given an adequate prior and a well-specified model, the untempered
  Bayesian posterior should achieve optimal performance. Despite the communityâ€™s extensive
  efforts, the observed gains in performance still remain disputed with several plausible
  causes pointing at its origin. While data augmentation has been empirically recognized
  as one of the main drivers of this effect, a theoretical account of its role, on
  the other hand, is largely missing. In this work we identify two interlaced factors
  concurrently influencing the strength of the cold posterior effect, namely the correlated
  nature of augmentations and the degree of invariance of the employed model to such
  transformations. By theoretically analyzing simplified settings, we prove that tempering
  implicitly reduces the misspecification arising from modeling augmentations as i.i.d.
  data. The temperature mimics the role of the effective sample size, reflecting the
  gain in information provided by the augmentations. We corroborate our theoretical
  findings with extensive empirical evaluations, scaling to realistic BNNs. By relying
  on the framework of group convolutions, we experiment with models of varying inherent
  degree of invariance, confirming its hypothesized relationship with the optimal
  temperature.
