title: A Stochastic Multi-Rate Control Framework For Modeling Distributed Optimization
  Algorithms
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In modern machine learning systems, distributed algorithms are deployed
  across applications to ensure data privacy and optimal utilization of computational
  resources. This work offers a fresh perspective to model, analyze, and design distributed
  optimization algorithms through the lens of stochastic multi-rate feedback control.
  We show that a substantial class of distributed algorithms—including popular Gradient
  Tracking for decentralized learning, and FedPD and Scaffold for federated learning—can
  be modeled as a certain discrete-time stochastic feedback-control system, possibly
  with multiple sampling rates. This key observation allows us to develop a generic
  framework to analyze the convergence of the entire algorithm class. It also enables
  one to easily add desirable features such as differential privacy guarantees, or
  to deal with practical settings such as partial agent participation, communication
  compression, and imperfect communication in algorithm design and analysis.
