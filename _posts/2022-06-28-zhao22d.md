title: Learning to Solve PDE-constrained Inverse Problems with Graph Networks
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Learned graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently been established as fast
  and accurate alternatives for principled solvers in simulating the dynamics of physical
  systems. In many application domains across science and engineering, however, we
  are not only interested in a forward simulation but also in solving inverse problems
  with constraints defined by a partial differential equation (PDE). Here we explore
  GNNs to solve such PDE-constrained inverse problems. Given a sparse set of measurements,
  we are interested in recovering the initial condition or parameters of the PDE.
  We demonstrate that GNNs combined with autodecoder-style priors are well-suited
  for these tasks, achieving more accurate estimates of initial conditions or physical
  parameters than other learned approaches when applied to the wave equation or Navier
  Stokes equations. We also demonstrate computational speedups of up to 90x using
  GNNs compared to principled solvers.
