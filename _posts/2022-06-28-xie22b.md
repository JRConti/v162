title: 'COAT: Measuring Object Compositionality in Emergent Representations'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Learning representations that can decompose a multi-object scene into its
  constituent objects and recompose them flexibly is desirable for object-oriented
  reasoning and planning. Built upon object masks in the pixel space, existing metrics
  for objectness can only evaluate generative models with an object-specific “slot”
  structure. We propose to directly measure compositionality in the representation
  space as a form of objections, making such evaluations tractable for a wider class
  of models. Our metric, COAT (Compositional Object Algebra Test), evaluates if a
  generic representation exhibits certain geometric properties that underpin object
  compositionality beyond what is already captured by the raw pixel space. Our experiments
  on the popular CLEVR (Johnson et.al., 2018) domain reveal that existing disentanglement-based
  generative models are not as compositional as one might expect, suggesting room
  for further modeling improvements. We hope our work allows for a unified evaluation
  of object-centric representations, spanning generative as well as discriminative,
  self-supervised models.
