title: Scaling Structured Inference with Randomization
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Deep discrete structured models have seen considerable progress recently,
  but traditional inference using dynamic programming (DP) typically works with a
  small number of states (less than hundreds), which severely limits model capacity.
  At the same time, across machine learning, there is a recent trend of using randomized
  truncation techniques to accelerate computations involving large sums. Here, we
  propose a family of randomized dynamic programming (RDP) algorithms for scaling
  structured models to tens of thousands of latent states. Our method is widely applicable
  to classical DP-based inference (partition, marginal, reparameterization, entropy)
  and different graph structures (chains, trees, and more general hypergraphs). It
  is also compatible with automatic differentiation: it can be integrated with neural
  networks seamlessly and learned with gradient-based optimizers. Our core technique
  approximates the sum-product by restricting and reweighting DP on a small subset
  of nodes, which reduces computation by orders of magnitude. We further achieve low
  bias and variance via Rao-Blackwellization and importance sampling. Experiments
  over different graphs demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our approach. Furthermore,
  when using RDP for training a structured variational autoencoder with a scaled inference
  network, we achieve better test likelihood than baselines and successfully prevent
  posterior collapse.'
