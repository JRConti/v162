title: Closed-Form Diffeomorphic Transformations for Time Series Alignment
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Time series alignment methods call for highly expressive, differentiable
  and invertible warping functions which preserve temporal topology, i.e diffeomorphisms.
  Diffeomorphic warping functions can be generated from the integration of velocity
  fields governed by an ordinary differential equation (ODE). Gradient-based optimization
  frameworks containing diffeomorphic transformations require to calculate derivatives
  to the differential equation’s solution with respect to the model parameters, i.e.
  sensitivity analysis. Unfortunately, deep learning frameworks typically lack automatic-differentiation-compatible
  sensitivity analysis methods; and implicit functions, such as the solution of ODE,
  require particular care. Current solutions appeal to adjoint sensitivity methods,
  ad-hoc numerical solvers or ResNet’s Eulerian discretization. In this work, we present
  a closed-form expression for the ODE solution and its gradient under continuous
  piecewise-affine (CPA) velocity functions. We present a highly optimized implementation
  of the results on CPU and GPU. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments on
  several datasets to validate the generalization ability of our model to unseen data
  for time-series joint alignment. Results show significant improvements both in terms
  of efficiency and accuracy.
