title: 'Plug & Play Attacks: Towards Robust and Flexible Model Inversion Attacks'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Model inversion attacks (MIAs) aim to create synthetic images that reflect
  the class-wise characteristics from a target classifier’s private training data
  by exploiting the model’s learned knowledge. Previous research has developed generative
  MIAs that use generative adversarial networks (GANs) as image priors tailored to
  a specific target model. This makes the attacks time- and resource-consuming, inflexible,
  and susceptible to distributional shifts between datasets. To overcome these drawbacks,
  we present Plug & Play Attacks, which relax the dependency between the target model
  and image prior, and enable the use of a single GAN to attack a wide range of targets,
  requiring only minor adjustments to the attack. Moreover, we show that powerful
  MIAs are possible even with publicly available pre-trained GANs and under strong
  distributional shifts, for which previous approaches fail to produce meaningful
  results. Our extensive evaluation confirms the improved robustness and flexibility
  of Plug & Play Attacks and their ability to create high-quality images revealing
  sensitive class characteristics.
