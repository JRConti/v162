title: Neuro-Symbolic Hierarchical Rule Induction
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We propose Neuro-Symbolic Hierarchical Rule Induction, an efficient interpretable
  neuro-symbolic model, to solve Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) problems. In this
  model, which is built from a pre-defined set of meta-rules organized in a hierarchical
  structure, first-order rules are invented by learning embeddings to match facts
  and body predicates of a meta-rule. To instantiate, we specifically design an expressive
  set of generic meta-rules, and demonstrate they generate a consequent fragment of
  Horn clauses. As a differentiable model, HRI can be trained both via supervised
  learning and reinforcement learning. To converge to interpretable rules, we inject
  a controlled noise to avoid local optima and employ an interpretability-regularization
  term. We empirically validate our model on various tasks (ILP, visual genome, reinforcement
  learning) against relevant state-of-the-art methods, including traditional ILP methods
  and neuro-symbolic models.
