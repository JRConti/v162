title: 'Score-Guided Intermediate Level Optimization: Fast Langevin Mixing for Inverse
  Problems'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We prove fast mixing and characterize the stationary distribution of the
  Langevin Algorithm for inverting random weighted DNN generators. This result extends
  the work of Hand and Voroninski from efficient inversion to efficient posterior
  sampling. In practice, to allow for increased expressivity, we propose to do posterior
  sampling in the latent space of a pre-trained generative model. To achieve that,
  we train a score-based model in the latent space of a StyleGAN-2 and we use it to
  solve inverse problems. Our framework, Score-Guided Intermediate Layer Optimization
  (SGILO), extends prior work by replacing the sparsity regularization with a generative
  prior in the intermediate layer. Experimentally, we obtain significant improvements
  over the previous state-of-the-art, especially in the low measurement regime.
