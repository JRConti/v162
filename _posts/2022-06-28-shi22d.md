title: Adversarial Masking for Self-Supervised Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We propose ADIOS, a masked image model (MIM) framework for self-supervised
  learning, which simultaneously learns a masking function and an image encoder using
  an adversarial objective. The image encoder is trained to minimise the distance
  between representations of the original and that of a masked image. The masking
  function, conversely, aims at maximising this distance. ADIOS consistently improves
  on state-of-the-art self-supervised learning (SSL) methods on a variety of tasks
  and datasets—including classification on ImageNet100 and STL10, transfer learning
  on CIFAR10/100, Flowers102 and iNaturalist, as well as robustness evaluated on the
  backgrounds challenge (Xiao et al., 2021)—while generating semantically meaningful
  masks. Unlike modern MIM models such as MAE, BEiT and iBOT, ADIOS does not rely
  on the image-patch tokenisation construction of Vision Transformers, and can be
  implemented with convolutional backbones. We further demonstrate that the masks
  learned by ADIOS are more effective in improving representation learning of SSL
  methods than masking schemes used in popular MIM models.
