title: Making Linear MDPs Practical via Contrastive Representation Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: It is common to address the curse of dimensionality in Markov decision processes
  (MDPs) by exploiting low-rank representations. This motivates much of the recent
  theoretical study on linear MDPs. However, most approaches require a given representation
  under unrealistic assumptions about the normalization of the decomposition or introduce
  unresolved computational challenges in practice. Instead, we consider an alternative
  definition of linear MDPs that automatically ensures normalization while allowing
  efficient representation learning via contrastive estimation. The framework also
  admits confidence-adjusted index algorithms, enabling an efficient and principled
  approach to incorporating optimism or pessimism in the face of uncertainty. To the
  best of our knowledge, this provides the first practical representation learning
  method for linear MDPs that achieves both strong theoretical guarantees and empirical
  performance. Theoretically, we prove that the proposed algorithm is sample efficient
  in both the online and offline settings. Empirically, we demonstrate superior performance
  over existing state-of-the-art model-based and model-free algorithms on several
  benchmarks.
