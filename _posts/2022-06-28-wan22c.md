title: Greedy based Value Representation for Optimal Coordination in Multi-agent Reinforcement
  Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Due to the representation limitation of the joint Q value function, multi-agent
  reinforcement learning methods with linear value decomposition (LVD) or monotonic
  value decomposition (MVD) suffer from relative overgeneralization. As a result,
  they can not ensure optimal consistency (i.e., the correspondence between individual
  greedy actions and the best team performance). In this paper, we derive the expression
  of the joint Q value function of LVD and MVD. According to the expression, we draw
  a transition diagram, where each self-transition node (STN) is a possible convergence.
  To ensure the optimal consistency, the optimal node is required to be the unique
  STN. Therefore, we propose the greedy-based value representation (GVR), which turns
  the optimal node into an STN via inferior target shaping and eliminates the non-optimal
  STNs via superior experience replay. Theoretical proofs and empirical results demonstrate
  that given the true Q values, GVR ensures the optimal consistency under sufficient
  exploration. Besides, in tasks where the true Q values are unavailable, GVR achieves
  an adaptive trade-off between optimality and stability. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art
  baselines in experiments on various benchmarks.
