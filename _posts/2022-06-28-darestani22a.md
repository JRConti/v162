title: Test-Time Training Can Close the Natural Distribution Shift Performance Gap
  in Deep Learning Based Compressed Sensing
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Deep learning based image reconstruction methods outperform traditional
  methods. However, neural networks suffer from a performance drop when applied to
  images from a different distribution than the training images. For example, a model
  trained for reconstructing knees in accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
  does not reconstruct brains well, even though the same network trained on brains
  reconstructs brains perfectly well. Thus there is a distribution shift performance
  gap for a given neural network, defined as the difference in performance when training
  on a distribution $P$ and training on another distribution $Q$, and evaluating both
  models on $Q$. In this work, we propose a domain adaptation method for deep learning
  based compressive sensing that relies on self-supervision during training paired
  with test-time training at inference. We show that for four natural distribution
  shifts, this method essentially closes the distribution shift performance gap for
  state-of-the-art architectures for accelerated MRI.
