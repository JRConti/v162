title: Optimal Algorithms for Stochastic Multi-Level Compositional Optimization
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of stochastic multi-level compositional
  optimization, where the objective function is a composition of multiple smooth but
  possibly non-convex functions. Existing methods for solving this problem either
  suffer from sub-optimal sample complexities or need a huge batch size. To address
  this limitation, we propose a Stochastic Multi-level Variance Reduction method (SMVR),
  which achieves the optimal sample complexity of $\mathcal{O}\left(1 / \epsilon^{3}\right)$
  to find an $\epsilon$-stationary point for non-convex objectives. Furthermore, when
  the objective function satisfies the convexity or Polyak-{≈Å}ojasiewicz (PL) condition,
  we propose a stage-wise variant of SMVR and improve the sample complexity to $\mathcal{O}\left(1
  / \epsilon^{2}\right)$ for convex functions or $\mathcal{O}\left(1 /(\mu\epsilon)\right)$
  for non-convex functions satisfying the $\mu$-PL condition. The latter result implies
  the same complexity for $\mu$-strongly convex functions. To make use of adaptive
  learning rates, we also develop Adaptive SMVR, which achieves the same optimal complexities
  but converges faster in practice. All our complexities match the lower bounds not
  only in terms of $\epsilon$ but also in terms of $\mu$ (for PL or strongly convex
  functions), without using a large batch size in each iteration.
