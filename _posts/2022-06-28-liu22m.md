title: Generating 3D Molecules for Target Protein Binding
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: A fundamental problem in drug discovery is to design molecules that bind
  to specific proteins. To tackle this problem using machine learning methods, here
  we propose a novel and effective framework, known as GraphBP, to generate 3D molecules
  that bind to given proteins by placing atoms of specific types and locations to
  the given binding site one by one. In particular, at each step, we first employ
  a 3D graph neural network to obtain geometry-aware and chemically informative representations
  from the intermediate contextual information. Such context includes the given binding
  site and atoms placed in the previous steps. Second, to preserve the desirable equivariance
  property, we select a local reference atom according to the designed auxiliary classifiers
  and then construct a local spherical coordinate system. Finally, to place a new
  atom, we generate its atom type and relative location w.r.t. the constructed local
  coordinate system via a flow model. We also consider generating the variables of
  interest sequentially to capture the underlying dependencies among them. Experiments
  demonstrate that our GraphBP is effective to generate 3D molecules with binding
  ability to target protein binding sites. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/divelab/GraphBP.
