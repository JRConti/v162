title: Domain Adaptation for Time Series Forecasting via Attention Sharing
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Recently, deep neural networks have gained increasing popularity in the
  field of time series forecasting. A primary reason for their success is their ability
  to effectively capture complex temporal dynamics across multiple related time series.
  The advantages of these deep forecasters only start to emerge in the presence of
  a sufficient amount of data. This poses a challenge for typical forecasting problems
  in practice, where there is a limited number of time series or observations per
  time series, or both. To cope with this data scarcity issue, we propose a novel
  domain adaptation framework, Domain Adaptation Forecaster (DAF). DAF leverages statistical
  strengths from a relevant domain with abundant data samples (source) to improve
  the performance on the domain of interest with limited data (target). In particular,
  we use an attention-based shared module with a domain discriminator across domains
  and private modules for individual domains. We induce domain-invariant latent features
  (queries and keys) and retrain domain-specific features (values) simultaneously
  to enable joint training of forecasters on source and target domains. A main insight
  is that our design of aligning keys allows the target domain to leverage source
  time series even with different characteristics. Extensive experiments on various
  domains demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
  on synthetic and real-world datasets, and ablation studies verify the effectiveness
  of our design choices.
