booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Pruning, the task of sparsifying deep neural networks, received increasing
  attention recently. Although state-of-the-art pruning methods extract highly sparse
  models, they neglect two main challenges: (1) the process of finding these sparse
  models is often very expensive; (2) unstructured pruning does not provide benefits
  in terms of GPU memory, training time, or carbon emissions. We propose Early Compression
  via Gradient Flow Preservation (EarlyCroP), which efficiently extracts state-of-the-art
  sparse models before or early in training addressing challenge (1), and can be applied
  in a structured manner addressing challenge (2). This enables us to train sparse
  networks on commodity GPUs whose dense versions would be too large, thereby saving
  costs and reducing hardware requirements. We empirically show that EarlyCroP outperforms
  a rich set of baselines for many tasks (incl. classification, regression) and domains
  (incl. computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcment learning).
  EarlyCroP leads to accuracy comparable to dense training while outperforming pruning
  baselines.'
