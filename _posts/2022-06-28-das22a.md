title: Knowledge Base Question Answering by Case-based Reasoning over Subgraphs
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Question answering (QA) over knowledge bases (KBs) is challenging because
  of the diverse, essentially unbounded, types of reasoning patterns needed. However,
  we hypothesize in a large KB, reasoning patterns required to answer a query type
  reoccur for various entities in their respective subgraph neighborhoods. Leveraging
  this structural similarity between local neighborhoods of different subgraphs, we
  introduce a semiparametric model (CBR-SUBG) with (i) a nonparametric component that
  for each query, dynamically retrieves other similar $k$-nearest neighbor (KNN) training
  queries along with query-specific subgraphs and (ii) a parametric component that
  is trained to identify the (latent) reasoning patterns from the subgraphs of KNN
  queries and then apply them to the subgraph of the target query. We also propose
  an adaptive subgraph collection strategy to select a query-specific compact subgraph,
  allowing us to scale to full Freebase KB containing billions of facts. We show that
  CBR-SUBG can answer queries requiring subgraph reasoning patterns and performs competitively
  with the best models on several KBQA benchmarks. Our subgraph collection strategy
  also produces more compact subgraphs (e.g. 55% reduction in size for WebQSP while
  increasing answer recall by 4.85%)\footnote{Code, model, and subgraphs are available
  at \url{https://github.com/rajarshd/CBR-SUBG}}.
