  Generalize'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Of theories for why large-scale machine learning models generalize despite
  being vastly overparameterized, which of their assumptions are needed to capture
  the qualitative phenomena of generalization in the real world? On one hand, we find
  that most theoretical analyses fall short of capturing these qualitative phenomena
  even for kernel regression, when applied to kernels derived from large-scale neural
  networks (e.g., ResNet-50) and real data (e.g., CIFAR-100). On the other hand, we
  find that the classical GCV estimator (Craven and Wahba, 1978) accurately predicts
  generalization risk even in such overparameterized settings. To bolster this empirical
  finding, we prove that the GCV estimator converges to the generalization risk whenever
  a local random matrix law holds. Finally, we apply this random matrix theory lens
  to explain why pretrained representations generalize better as well as what factors
  govern scaling laws for kernel regression. Our findings suggest that random matrix
  theory, rather than just being a toy model, may be central to understanding the
  properties of neural representations in practice.
