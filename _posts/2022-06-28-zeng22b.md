title: Efficient PAC Learning from the Crowd with Pairwise Comparisons
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We study crowdsourced PAC learning of threshold function, where the labels
  are gathered from a pool of annotators some of whom may behave adversarially. This
  is yet a challenging problem and until recently has computationally and query efficient
  PAC learning algorithm been established by Awasthi et al. (2017). In this paper,
  we show that by leveraging the more easily acquired pairwise comparison queries,
  it is possible to exponentially reduce the label complexity while retaining the
  overall query complexity and runtime. Our main algorithmic contributions are a comparison-equipped
  labeling scheme that can faithfully recover the true labels of a small set of instances,
  and a label-efficient filtering process that in conjunction with the small labeled
  set can reliably infer the true labels of a large instance set.
