title: The dynamics of representation learning in shallow, non-linear autoencoders
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Autoencoders are the simplest neural network for unsupervised learning,
  and thus an ideal framework for studying feature learning. While a detailed understanding
  of the dynamics of linear autoencoders has recently been obtained, the study of
  non-linear autoencoders has been hindered by the technical difficulty of handling
  training data with non-trivial correlations {â€“} a fundamental prerequisite for feature
  extraction. Here, we study the dynamics of feature learning in non-linear, shallow
  autoencoders. We derive a set of asymptotically exact equations that describe the
  generalisation dynamics of autoencoders trained with stochastic gradient descent
  (SGD) in the limit of high-dimensional inputs. These equations reveal that autoencoders
  learn the leading principal components of their inputs sequentially. An analysis
  of the long-time dynamics explains the failure of sigmoidal autoencoders to learn
  with tied weights, and highlights the importance of training the bias in ReLU autoencoders.
  Building on previous results for linear networks, we analyse a modification of the
  vanilla SGD algorithm which allows learning of the exact principal components. Finally,
  we show that our equations accurately describe the generalisation dynamics of non-linear
  autoencoders on realistic datasets such as CIFAR10.
