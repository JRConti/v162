title: 'Transfer and Marginalize: Explaining Away Label Noise with Privileged Information'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Supervised learning datasets often have privileged information, in the
  form of features which are available at training time but are not available at test
  time e.g. the ID of the annotator that provided the label. We argue that privileged
  information is useful for explaining away label noise, thereby reducing the harmful
  impact of noisy labels. We develop a simple and efficient method for supervised
  learning with neural networks: it transfers via weight sharing the knowledge learned
  with privileged information and approximately marginalizes over privileged information
  at test time. Our method, TRAM (TRansfer and Marginalize), has minimal training
  time overhead and has the same test-time cost as not using privileged information.
  TRAM performs strongly on CIFAR-10H, ImageNet and Civil Comments benchmarks.'
