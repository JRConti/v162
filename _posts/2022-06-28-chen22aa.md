title: Robust Meta-learning with Sampling Noise and Label Noise via Eigen-Reptile
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Recent years have seen a surge of interest in meta-learning techniques for
  tackling the few-shot learning (FSL) problem. However, the meta-learner is prone
  to overfitting since there are only a few available samples, which can be identified
  as sampling noise on a clean dataset. Besides, when handling the data with noisy
  labels, the meta-learner could be extremely sensitive to label noise on a corrupted
  dataset. To address these two challenges, we present Eigen-Reptile (ER) that updates
  the meta-parameters with the main direction of historical task-specific parameters.
  Specifically, the main direction is computed in a fast way, where the scale of the
  calculated matrix is related to the number of gradient steps for the specific task
  instead of the number of parameters. Furthermore, to obtain a more accurate main
  direction for Eigen-Reptile in the presence of many noisy labels, we further propose
  Introspective Self-paced Learning (ISPL). We have theoretically and experimentally
  demonstrated the soundness and effectiveness of the proposed Eigen-Reptile and ISPL.
  Particularly, our experiments on different tasks show that the proposed method is
  able to outperform or achieve highly competitive performance compared with other
  gradient-based methods with or without noisy labels. The code and data for the proposed
  method are provided for research purposes https://github.com/Anfeather/Eigen-Reptile.
