title: Permutation Search of Tensor Network Structures via Local Sampling
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Recent works put much effort into <em>tensor network structure search</em>
  (TN-SS), aiming to select suitable tensor network (TN) structures, involving the
  TN-ranks, formats, and so on, for the decomposition or learning tasks. In this paper,
  we consider a practical variant of TN-SS, dubbed <em>TN permutation search</em>Â (TN-PS),
  in which we search for good mappings from tensor modes onto TN vertices (core tensors)
  for compact TN representations. We conduct a theoretical investigation of TN-PS
  and propose a practically-efficient algorithm to resolve the problem. Theoretically,
  we prove the counting and metric properties of search spaces of TN-PS, analyzing
  for the first time the impact of TN structures on these unique properties. Numerically,
  we propose a novel <em>meta-heuristic</em> algorithm, in which the searching is
  done by randomly sampling in a neighborhood established in our theory, and then
  recurrently updating the neighborhood until convergence. Numerical results demonstrate
  that the new algorithm can reduce the required model size of TNs in extensive benchmarks,
  implying the improvement in the expressive power of TNs. Furthermore, the computational
  cost for the new algorithm is significantly less than that in (Li and Sun, 2020).
