title: Nonparametric Factor Trajectory Learning for Dynamic Tensor Decomposition
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Tensor decomposition is a fundamental framework to analyze data that can
  be represented by multi-dimensional arrays. In practice, tensor data are often accompanied
  with temporal information, namely the time points when the entry values were generated.
  This information implies abundant, complex temporal variation patterns. However,
  current methods always assume the factor representations of the entities in each
  tensor mode are static, and never consider their temporal evolution. To fill this
  gap, we propose NONparametric FActor Trajectory learning for dynamic tensor decomposition
  (NONFAT). We place Gaussian process (GP) priors in the frequency domain and conduct
  inverse Fourier transform via Gauss-Laguerre quadrature to sample the trajectory
  functions. In this way, we can overcome data sparsity and obtain robust trajectory
  estimates across long time horizons. Given the trajectory values at specific time
  points, we use a second-level GP to sample the entry values and to capture the temporal
  relationship between the entities. For efficient and scalable inference, we leverage
  the matrix Gaussian structure in the model, introduce a matrix Gaussian posterior,
  and develop a nested sparse variational learning algorithm. We have shown the advantage
  of our method in several real-world applications.
