title: On Implicit Bias in Overparameterized Bilevel Optimization
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Many problems in machine learning involve bilevel optimization (BLO), including
  hyperparameter optimization, meta-learning, and dataset distillation. Bilevel problems
  involve inner and outer parameters, each optimized for its own objective. Often,
  at least one of the two levels is underspecified and there are multiple ways to
  choose among equivalent optima. Inspired by recent studies of the implicit bias
  induced by optimization algorithms in single-level optimization, we investigate
  the implicit bias of different gradient-based algorithms for jointly optimizing
  the inner and outer parameters. We delineate two standard BLO methods—cold-start
  and warm-start BLO—and show that the converged solution or long-run behavior depends
  to a large degree on these and other algorithmic choices, such as the hypergradient
  approximation. We also show that the solutions from warm-start BLO can encode a
  surprising amount of information about the outer objective, even when the outer
  optimization variables are low-dimensional. We believe that implicit bias deserves
  as central a role in the study of bilevel optimization as it has attained in the
  study of single-level neural net optimization.
