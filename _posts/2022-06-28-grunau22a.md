title: Adapting k-means Algorithms for Outliers
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'This paper shows how to adapt several simple and classical sampling-based
  algorithms for the k-means problem to the setting with outliers. Recently, Bhaskara
  et al. (NeurIPS 2019) showed how to adapt the classical k-means++ algorithm to the
  setting with outliers. However, their algorithm needs to output O(log(k)$\cdot$z)
  outliers, where z is the number of true outliers, to match the O(log k)-approximation
  guarantee of k-means++. In this paper, we build on their ideas and show how to adapt
  several sequential and distributed k-means algorithms to the setting with outliers,
  but with substantially stronger theoretical guarantees: our algorithms output (1
  + $\epsilon$)z outliers while achieving an O(1/$\epsilon$)-approximation to the
  objective function. In the sequential world, we achieve this by adapting a recent
  algorithm of Lattanzi and Sohler (ICML 2019). In the distributed setting, we adapt
  a simple algorithm of Guha et al. (IEEE Trans. Know. and Data Engineering 2003)
  and the popular k-means\|{of} Bahmani et al. (PVLDB2012). A theoretical application
  of our techniques is an algorithm with running time O(nk^2/z) that achieves an O(1)-approximation
  to the objective function while outputting O(z) outliers, assuming k << z << n.
  This is complemented with a matching lower bound of $\Omega$(nk^2/z) for this problem
  in the oracle model.'
