  optimization'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The Approximate-Proximal Point (APROX) family of model-based stochastic
  optimization algorithms improve over standard stochastic gradient methods, as they
  are robust to step size choices, adaptive to problem difficulty, converge on a broader
  range of problems than stochastic gradient methods, and converge very fast on interpolation
  problems, all while retaining nice minibatching propertiesÂ \cite{AsiDu19siopt,AsiChChDu20}.
  In this paper, we propose an acceleration scheme for the APROX family and provide
  non-asymptotic convergence guarantees, which are order-optimal in all problem-dependent
  constants and provide even larger minibatching speedups. For interpolation problems
  where the objective satisfies additional growth conditions, we show that our algorithm
  achieves linear convergence rates for a wide range of stepsizes. In this setting,
  we also prove matching lower bounds, identifying new fundamental constants and showing
  the optimality of the APROX family. We corroborate our theoretical results with
  empirical testing to demonstrate the gains accurate modeling, acceleration, and
  minibatching provide.
