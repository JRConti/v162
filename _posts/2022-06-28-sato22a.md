title: 'PoF: Post-Training of Feature Extractor for Improving Generalization'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'It has been intensively investigated that the local shape, especially flatness,
  of the loss landscape near a minimum plays an important role for generalization
  of deep models. We developed a training algorithm called PoF: Post-Training of Feature
  Extractor that updates the feature extractor part of an already-trained deep model
  to search a flatter minimum. The characteristics are two-fold: 1) Feature extractor
  is trained under parameter perturbations in the higher-layer parameter space, based
  on observations that suggest flattening higher-layer parameter space, and 2) the
  perturbation range is determined in a data-driven manner aiming to reduce a part
  of test loss caused by the positive loss curvature. We provide a theoretical analysis
  that shows the proposed algorithm implicitly reduces the target Hessian components
  as well as the loss. Experimental results show that PoF improved model performance
  against baseline methods on both CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets for only 10-epoch
  post-training, and on SVHN dataset for 50-epoch post-training.'
