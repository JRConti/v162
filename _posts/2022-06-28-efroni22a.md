title: Provable Reinforcement Learning with a Short-Term Memory
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Real-world sequential decision making problems commonly involve partial
  observability, which requires the agent to maintain a memory of history in order
  to infer the latent states, plan and make good decisions. Coping with partial observability
  in general is extremely challenging, as a number of worst-case statistical and computational
  barriers are known in learning Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs).
  Motivated by the problem structure in several physical applications, as well as
  a commonly used technique known as "frame stacking", this paper proposes to study
  a new subclass of POMDPs, whose latent states can be decoded by the most recent
  history of a short length m. We establish a set of upper and lower bounds on the
  sample complexity for learning near-optimal policies for this class of problems
  in both tabular and rich-observation settings (where the number of observations
  is enormous). In particular, in the rich-observation setting, we develop new algorithms
  using a novel "moment matching" approach with a sample complexity that scales exponentially
  with the short length m rather than the problem horizon, and is independent of the
  number of observations. Our results show that a short-term memory suffices for reinforcement
  learning in these environments.
