title: Diffusion Models for Adversarial Purification
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Adversarial purification refers to a class of defense methods that remove
  adversarial perturbations using a generative model. These methods do not make assumptions
  on the form of attack and the classification model, and thus can defend pre-existing
  classifiers against unseen threats. However, their performance currently falls behind
  adversarial training methods. In this work, we propose DiffPure that uses diffusion
  models for adversarial purification: Given an adversarial example, we first diffuse
  it with a small amount of noise following a forward diffusion process, and then
  recover the clean image through a reverse generative process. To evaluate our method
  against strong adaptive attacks in an efficient and scalable way, we propose to
  use the adjoint method to compute full gradients of the reverse generative process.
  Extensive experiments on three image datasets including CIFAR-10, ImageNet and CelebA-HQ
  with three classifier architectures including ResNet, WideResNet and ViT demonstrate
  that our method achieves the state-of-the-art results, outperforming current adversarial
  training and adversarial purification methods, often by a large margin.'
