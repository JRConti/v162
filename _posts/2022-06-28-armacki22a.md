title: Gradient Based Clustering
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We propose a general approach for distance based clustering, using the gradient
  of the cost function that measures clustering quality with respect to cluster assignments
  and cluster center positions. The approach is an iterative two step procedure (alternating
  between cluster assignment and cluster center updates) and is applicable to a wide
  range of functions, satisfying some mild assumptions. The main advantage of the
  proposed approach is a simple and computationally cheap update rule. Unlike previous
  methods that specialize to a specific formulation of the clustering problem, our
  approach is applicable to a wide range of costs, including non-Bregman clustering
  methods based on the Huber loss. We analyze the convergence of the proposed algorithm,
  and show that it converges to the set of appropriately defined fixed points, under
  arbitrary center initialization. In the special case of Bregman cost functions,
  the algorithm converges to the set of centroidal Voronoi partitions, which is consistent
  with prior works. Numerical experiments on real data demonstrate the effectiveness
  of the proposed method.
