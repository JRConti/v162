title: Divergence-Regularized Multi-Agent Actor-Critic
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Entropy regularization is a popular method in reinforcement learning (RL).
  Although it has many advantages, it alters the RL objective and makes the converged
  policy deviate from the optimal policy of the original Markov Decision Process (MDP).
  Though divergence regularization has been proposed to settle this problem, it cannot
  be trivially applied to cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). In
  this paper, we investigate divergence regularization in cooperative MARL and propose
  a novel off-policy cooperative MARL framework, divergence-regularized multi-agent
  actor-critic (DMAC). Theoretically, we derive the update rule of DMAC which is naturally
  off-policy, guarantees the monotonic policy improvement and convergence in both
  the original MDP and the divergence-regularized MDP, and is not biased by the regularization.
  We also give a bound of the discrepancy between the converged policy and the optimal
  policy in the original MDP. DMAC is a flexible framework and can be combined with
  many existing MARL algorithms. Empirically, we evaluate DMAC in a didactic stochastic
  game and StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge and show that DMAC substantially improves
  the performance of existing MARL algorithms.
