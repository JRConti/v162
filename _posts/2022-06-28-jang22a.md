title: Sequential Covariate Shift Detection Using Classifier Two-Sample Tests
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: A standard assumption in supervised learning is that the training data and
  test data are from the same distribution. However, this assumption often fails to
  hold in practice, which can cause the learned model to perform poorly. We consider
  the problem of detecting covariate shift, where the covariate distribution shifts
  but the conditional distribution of labels given covariates remains the same. This
  problem can naturally be solved using a two-sample test{—}i.e., test whether the
  current test distribution of covariates equals the training distribution of covariates.
  Our algorithm builds on classifier tests, which train a discriminator to distinguish
  train and test covariates, and then use the accuracy of this discriminator as a
  test statistic. A key challenge is that classifier tests assume given a fixed set
  of test covariates. In practice, test covariates often arrive sequentially over
  time{—}e.g., a self-driving car observes a stream of images while driving. Furthermore,
  covariate shift can occur multiple times{—}i.e., shift and then shift back later
  or gradually shift over time. To address these challenges, our algorithm trains
  the discriminator online. Additionally, it evaluates test accuracy using each new
  covariate before taking a gradient step; this strategy avoids constructing a held-out
  test set, which can improve sample efficiency. We prove that this optimization preserves
  the correctness{—}i.e., our algorithm achieves a desired bound on the false positive
  rate. In our experiments, we show that our algorithm efficiently detects covariate
  shifts on multiple datasets{—}ImageNet, IWildCam, and Py150.
