title: 'Neurocoder: General-Purpose Computation Using Stored Neural Programs'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Artificial Neural Networks are functionally equivalent to special-purpose
  computers. Their inter-neuronal connection weights represent the learnt Neural Program
  that instructs the networks on how to compute the data. However, without storing
  Neural Programs, they are restricted to only one, overwriting learnt programs when
  trained on new data. Here we design Neurocoder, a new class of general-purpose neural
  networks in which the neural network “codes” itself in a data-responsive way by
  composing relevant programs from a set of shareable, modular programs stored in
  external memory. This time, a Neural Program is efficiently treated as data in memory.
  Integrating Neurocoder into current neural architectures, we demonstrate new capacity
  to learn modular programs, reuse simple programs to build complex ones, handle pattern
  shifts and remember old programs as new ones are learnt, and show substantial performance
  improvement in solving object recognition, playing video games and continual learning
  tasks.
