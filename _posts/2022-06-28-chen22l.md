title: Online Active Regression
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Active regression considers a linear regression problem where the learner
  receives a large number of data points but can only observe a small number of labels.
  Since online algorithms can deal with incremental training data and take advantage
  of low computational cost, we consider an online extension of the active regression
  problem: the learner receives data points one by one and immediately decides whether
  it should collect the corresponding labels. The goal is to efficiently maintain
  the regression of received data points with a small budget of label queries. We
  propose novel algorithms for this problem under $\ell_p$ loss where $p\in[1,2]$.
  To achieve a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate solution, our proposed algorithms only requires
  $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d/poly(\epsilon))$ queries of labels. The numerical results
  verify our theoretical results and show that our methods have comparable performance
  with offline active regression algorithms.'
