title: 'Breaking the $\sqrtT$ Barrier: Instance-Independent Logarithmic Regret in
  Stochastic Contextual Linear Bandits'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'We prove an instance independent (poly) logarithmic regret for stochastic
  contextual bandits with linear payoff. Previously, in \cite{chu2011contextual},
  a lower bound of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ is shown for the contextual linear bandit
  problem with arbitrary (adversarily chosen) contexts. In this paper, we show that
  stochastic contexts indeed help to reduce the regret from $\sqrt{T}$ to $\polylog(T)$.
  We propose Low Regret Stochastic Contextual Bandits (\texttt{LR-SCB}), which takes
  advantage of the stochastic contexts and performs parameter estimation (in $\ell_2$
  norm) and regret minimization simultaneously. \texttt{LR-SCB} works in epochs, where
  the parameter estimation of the previous epoch is used to reduce the regret of the
  current epoch. The (poly) logarithmic regret of \texttt{LR-SCB} stems from two crucial
  facts: (a) the application of a norm adaptive algorithm to exploit the parameter
  estimation and (b) an analysis of the shifted linear contextual bandit algorithm,
  showing that shifting results in increasing regret. We have also shown experimentally
  that stochastic contexts indeed incurs a regret that scales with $\polylog(T)$.'
