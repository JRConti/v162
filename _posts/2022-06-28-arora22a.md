title: Understanding Gradient Descent on the Edge of Stability in Deep Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Deep learning experiments by \citet{cohen2021gradient} using deterministic
  Gradient Descent (GD) revealed an <em>Edge of Stability (EoS)</em> phase when learning
  rate (LR) and sharpness (<em>i.e.</em>, the largest eigenvalue of Hessian) no longer
  behave as in traditional optimization. Sharpness stabilizes around $2/$LR and loss
  goes up and down across iterations, yet still with an overall downward trend. The
  current paper mathematically analyzes a new mechanism of implicit regularization
  in the EoS phase, whereby GD updates due to non-smooth loss landscape turn out to
  evolve along some deterministic flow on the manifold of minimum loss. This is in
  contrast to many previous results about implicit bias either relying on infinitesimal
  updates or noise in gradient. Formally, for any smooth function $L$ with certain
  regularity condition, this effect is demonstrated for (1) <em>Normalized GD</em>,
  i.e., GD with a varying LR $\eta_t =\frac{\eta}{\norm{\nabla L(x(t))}}$ and loss
  $L$; (2) GD with constant LR and loss $\sqrt{L- \min_x L(x)}$. Both provably enter
  the Edge of Stability, with the associated flow on the manifold minimizing $\lambda_{1}(\nabla^2
  L)$. The above theoretical results have been corroborated by an experimental study.
