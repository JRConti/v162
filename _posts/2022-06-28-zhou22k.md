title: Modeling Adversarial Noise for Adversarial Training
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Deep neural networks have been demonstrated to be vulnerable to adversarial
  noise, promoting the development of defense against adversarial attacks. Motivated
  by the fact that adversarial noise contains well-generalizing features and that
  the relationship between adversarial data and natural data can help infer natural
  data and make reliable predictions, in this paper, we study to model adversarial
  noise by learning the transition relationship between adversarial labels (i.e. the
  flipped labels used to generate adversarial data) and natural labels (i.e. the ground
  truth labels of the natural data). Specifically, we introduce an instance-dependent
  transition matrix to relate adversarial labels and natural labels, which can be
  seamlessly embedded with the target model (enabling us to model stronger adaptive
  adversarial noise). Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method could effectively
  improve adversarial accuracy.
