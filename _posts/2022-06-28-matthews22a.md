title: Continual Repeated Annealed Flow Transport Monte Carlo
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We propose Continual Repeated Annealed Flow Transport Monte Carlo (CRAFT),
  a method that combines a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) sampler (itself a generalization
  of Annealed Importance Sampling) with variational inference using normalizing flows.
  The normalizing flows are directly trained to transport between annealing temperatures
  using a KL divergence for each transition. This optimization objective is itself
  estimated using the normalizing flow/SMC approximation. We show conceptually and
  using multiple empirical examples that CRAFT improves on Annealed Flow Transport
  Monte Carlo (Arbel et al., 2021), on which it builds and also on Markov chain Monte
  Carlo (MCMC) based Stochastic Normalizing Flows (Wu et al., 2020). By incorporating
  CRAFT within particle MCMC, we show that such learnt samplers can achieve impressively
  accurate results on a challenging lattice field theory example.
