title: Online and Consistent Correlation Clustering
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In the correlation clustering problem the input is a signed graph where
  the sign indicates whether each pair of points should be placed in the same cluster
  or not. The goal of the problem is to compute a clustering which minimizes the number
  of disagreements with such recommendation. Thanks to its many practical applications,
  correlation clustering is a fundamental unsupervised learning problem and has been
  extensively studied in many different settings. In this paper we study the problem
  in the classic online setting with recourse; The vertices of the graphs arrive in
  an online manner and the goal is to maintain an approximate clustering while minimizing
  the number of times each vertex changes cluster. Our main contribution is an algorithm
  that achieves logarithmic recourse per vertex in the worst case. We also complement
  this result with a tight lower bound. Finally we show experimentally that our algorithm
  achieves better performances than state-of-the-art algorithms on real world data.
