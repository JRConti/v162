title: 'The Neural Race Reduction: Dynamics of Abstraction in Gated Networks'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Our theoretical understanding of deep learning has not kept pace with its
  empirical success. While network architecture is known to be critical, we do not
  yet understand its effect on learned representations and network behavior, or how
  this architecture should reflect task structure.In this work, we begin to address
  this gap by introducing the Gated Deep Linear Network framework that schematizes
  how pathways of information flow impact learning dynamics within an architecture.
  Crucially, because of the gating, these networks can compute nonlinear functions
  of their input. We derive an exact reduction and, for certain cases, exact solutions
  to the dynamics of learning. Our analysis demonstrates that the learning dynamics
  in structured networks can be conceptualized as a neural race with an implicit bias
  towards shared representations, which then govern the modelâ€™s ability to systematically
  generalize, multi-task, and transfer. We validate our key insights on naturalistic
  datasets and with relaxed assumptions. Taken together, our work gives rise to general
  hypotheses relating neural architecture to learning and provides a mathematical
  approach towards understanding the design of more complex architectures and the
  role of modularity and compositionality in solving real-world problems. The code
  and results are available at https://www.saxelab.org/gated-dln.
