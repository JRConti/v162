title: Selective Network Linearization for Efficient Private Inference
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Private inference (PI) enables inferences directly on cryptographically
  secure data. While promising to address many privacy issues, it has seen limited
  use due to extreme runtimes. Unlike plaintext inference, where latency is dominated
  by FLOPs, in PI non-linear functions (namely ReLU) are the bottleneck. Thus, practical
  PI demands novel ReLU-aware optimizations. To reduce PI latency we propose a gradient-based
  algorithm that selectively linearizes ReLUs while maintaining prediction accuracy.
  We evaluate our algorithm on several standard PI benchmarks. The results demonstrate
  up to $4.25%$ more accuracy (iso-ReLU count at 50K) or $2.2\times$ less latency
  (iso-accuracy at 70%) than the current state of the art and advance the Pareto frontier
  across the latency-accuracy space. To complement empirical results, we present a
  â€œno free lunch" theorem that sheds light on how and when network linearization is
  possible while maintaining prediction accuracy.
