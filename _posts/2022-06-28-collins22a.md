title: MAML and ANIL Provably Learn Representations
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Recent empirical evidence has driven conventional wisdom to believe that
  gradient-based meta-learning (GBML) methods perform well at few-shot learning because
  they learn an expressive data representation that is shared across tasks. However,
  the mechanics of GBML have remained largely mysterious from a theoretical perspective.
  In this paper, we prove that two well-known GBML methods, MAML and ANIL, as well
  as their first-order approximations, are capable of learning common representation
  among a set of given tasks. Specifically, in the well-known multi-task linear representation
  learning setting, they are able to recover the ground-truth representation at an
  exponentially fast rate. Moreover, our analysis illuminates that the driving force
  causing MAML and ANIL to recover the underlying representation is that they adapt
  the final layer of their model, which harnesses the underlying task diversity to
  improve the representation in all directions of interest. To the best of our knowledge,
  these are the first results to show that MAML and/or ANIL learn expressive representations
  and to rigorously explain why they do so.
