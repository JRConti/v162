title: 'Sparse Mixed Linear Regression with Guarantees: Taming an Intractable Problem
  with Invex Relaxation'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of sparse mixed linear regression on
  an unlabeled dataset that is generated from linear measurements from two different
  regression parameter vectors. Since the data is unlabeled, our task is to not only
  figure out a good approximation of regression parameter vectors but also label the
  dataset correctly. In its original form, this problem is NP-hard. The most popular
  algorithms to solve this problem (such as Expectation-Maximization) have a tendency
  to stuck at local minima. We provide a novel invex relaxation for this intractable
  problem which leads to a solution with provable theoretical guarantees. This relaxation
  enables exact recovery of data labels. Furthermore, we recover close approximation
  of regression parameter vectors which match the true parameter vectors in support
  and sign. Our formulation uses a carefully constructed primal dual witnesses framework
  for the invex problem. Furthermore, we show that the sample complexity of our method
  is only logarithmic in terms of the dimension of the regression parameter vectors.
