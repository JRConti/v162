title: 'SQ-VAE: Variational Bayes on Discrete Representation with Self-annealed Stochastic
  Quantization'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: One noted issue of vector-quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) is
  that the learned discrete representation uses only a fraction of the full capacity
  of the codebook, also known as codebook collapse. We hypothesize that the training
  scheme of VQ-VAE, which involves some carefully designed heuristics, underlies this
  issue. In this paper, we propose a new training scheme that extends the standard
  VAE via novel stochastic dequantization and quantization, called stochastically
  quantized variational autoencoder (SQ-VAE). In SQ-VAE, we observe a trend that the
  quantization is stochastic at the initial stage of the training but gradually converges
  toward a deterministic quantization, which we call self-annealing. Our experiments
  show that SQ-VAE improves codebook utilization without using common heuristics.
  Furthermore, we empirically show that SQ-VAE is superior to VAE and VQ-VAE in vision-
  and speech-related tasks.
