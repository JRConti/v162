title: Provable Acceleration of Heavy Ball beyond Quadratics for a Class of Polyak-Lojasiewicz
  Functions when the Non-Convexity is Averaged-Out
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Heavy Ball (HB) nowadays is one of the most popular momentum methods in
  non-convex optimization. It has been widely observed that incorporating the Heavy
  Ball dynamic in gradient-based methods accelerates the training process of modern
  machine learning models. However, the progress on establishing its theoretical foundation
  of acceleration is apparently far behind its empirical success. Existing provable
  acceleration results are of the quadratic or close-to-quadratic functions, as the
  current techniques of showing HBâ€™s acceleration are limited to the case when the
  Hessian is fixed. In this work, we develop some new techniques that help show acceleration
  beyond quadratics, which is achieved by analyzing how the change of the Hessian
  at two consecutive time points affects the convergence speed. Based on our technical
  results, a class of Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) optimization problems for which provable
  acceleration can be achieved via HB is identified. Moreover, our analysis demonstrates
  a benefit of adaptively setting the momentum parameter.
