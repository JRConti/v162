title: 'Cascaded Gaps: Towards Logarithmic Regret for Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement
  Learning'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In this paper, we study gap-dependent regret guarantees for risk-sensitive
  reinforcement learning based on the entropic risk measure. We propose a novel definition
  of sub-optimality gaps, which we call cascaded gaps, and we discuss their key components
  that adapt to underlying structures of the problem. Based on the cascaded gaps,
  we derive non-asymptotic and logarithmic regret bounds for two model-free algorithms
  under episodic Markov decision processes. We show that, in appropriate settings,
  these bounds feature exponential improvement over existing ones that are independent
  of gaps. We also prove gap-dependent lower bounds, which certify the near optimality
  of the upper bounds.
