title: Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder with Contrastive Learning for Multi-Label
  Classification
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Multi-label classification (MLC) is a prediction task where each sample
  can have more than one label. We propose a novel contrastive learning boosted multi-label
  prediction model based on a Gaussian mixture variational autoencoder (C-GMVAE),
  which learns a multimodal prior space and employs a contrastive loss. Many existing
  methods introduce extra complex neural modules like graph neural networks to capture
  the label correlations, in addition to the prediction modules. We find that by using
  contrastive learning in the supervised setting, we can exploit label information
  effectively in a data-driven manner, and learn meaningful feature and label embeddings
  which capture the label correlations and enhance the predictive power. Our method
  also adopts the idea of learning and aligning latent spaces for both features and
  labels. In contrast to previous works based on a unimodal prior, C-GMVAE imposes
  a Gaussian mixture structure on the latent space, to alleviate the posterior collapse
  and over-regularization issues. C-GMVAE outperforms existing methods on multiple
  public datasets and can often match other modelsâ€™ full performance with only 50%
  of the training data. Furthermore, we show that the learnt embeddings provide insights
  into the interpretation of label-label interactions.
