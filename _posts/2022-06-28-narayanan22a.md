title: Tight and Robust Private Mean Estimation with Few Users
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In this work, we study high-dimensional mean estimation under user-level
  differential privacy, and design an $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-differentially private
  mechanism using as few users as possible. In particular, we provide a nearly optimal
  trade-off between the number of users and the number of samples per user required
  for private mean estimation, even when the number of users is as low as $O(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\log\frac{1}{\delta})$.
  Interestingly, this bound on the number of <em>users</em> is independent of the
  dimension (though the number of <em>samples per user</em> is allowed to depend polynomially
  on the dimension), unlike the previous work that requires the number of users to
  depend polynomially on the dimension. This resolves a problem first proposed by
  Amin et al. (2019). Moreover, our mechanism is robust against corruptions in up
  to $49%$ of the users. Finally, our results also apply to optimal algorithms for
  privately learning discrete distributions with few users, answering a question of
  Liu et al. (2020), and a broader range of problems such as stochastic convex optimization
  and a variant of stochastic gradient descent via a reduction to differentially private
  mean estimation.
