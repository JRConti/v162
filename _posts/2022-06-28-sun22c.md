title: 'MAE-DET: Revisiting Maximum Entropy Principle in Zero-Shot NAS for Efficient
  Object Detection'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In object detection, the detection backbone consumes more than half of the
  overall inference cost. Recent researches attempt to reduce this cost by optimizing
  the backbone architecture with the help of Neural Architecture Search (NAS). However,
  existing NAS methods for object detection require hundreds to thousands of GPU hours
  of searching, making them impractical in fast-paced research and development. In
  this work, we propose a novel zero-shot NAS method to address this issue. The proposed
  method, named MAE-DET, automatically designs efficient detection backbones via the
  Maximum Entropy Principle without training network parameters, reducing the architecture
  design cost to nearly zero yet delivering the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.
  Under the hood, MAE-DET maximizes the differential entropy of detection backbones,
  leading to a better feature extractor for object detection under the same computational
  budgets. After merely one GPU day of fully automatic design, MAE-DET innovates SOTA
  detection backbones on multiple detection benchmark datasets with little human intervention.
  Comparing to ResNet-50 backbone, MAE-DET is $+2.0%$ better in mAP when using the
  same amount of FLOPs/parameters, and is $1.54$ times faster on NVIDIA V100 at the
  same mAP. Code and pre-trained models are available here (https://github.com/alibaba/lightweight-neural-architecture-search).
