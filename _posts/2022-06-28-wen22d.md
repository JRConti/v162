title: 'Fighting Fire with Fire: Avoiding DNN Shortcuts through Priming'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Across applications spanning supervised classification and sequential control,
  deep learning has been reported to find “shortcut” solutions that fail catastrophically
  under minor changes in the data distribution. In this paper, we show empirically
  that DNNs can be coaxed to avoid poor shortcuts by providing an additional “priming”
  feature computed from key input features, usually a coarse output estimate. Priming
  relies on approximate domain knowledge of these task-relevant key input features,
  which is often easy to obtain in practical settings. For example, one might prioritize
  recent frames over past frames in a video input for visual imitation learning, or
  salient foreground over background pixels for image classification. On NICO image
  classification, MuJoCo continuous control, and CARLA autonomous driving, our priming
  strategy works significantly better than several popular state-of-the-art approaches
  for feature selection and data augmentation. We connect these empirical findings
  to recent theoretical results on DNN optimization, and argue theoretically that
  priming distracts the optimizer away from poor shortcuts by creating better, simpler
  shortcuts.
