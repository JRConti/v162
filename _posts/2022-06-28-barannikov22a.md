  Representations.'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Comparison of data representations is a complex multi-aspect problem. We
  propose a method for comparing two data representations. We introduce the Representation
  Topology Divergence (RTD) score measuring the dissimilarity in multi-scale topology
  between two point clouds of equal size with a one-to-one correspondence between
  points. The two data point clouds can lie in different ambient spaces. The RTD score
  is one of the few topological data analysis based practical methods applicable to
  real machine learning datasets. Experiments show the agreement of RTD with the intuitive
  assessment of data representation similarity. The proposed RTD score is sensitive
  to the data representationâ€™s fine topological structure. We use the RTD score to
  gain insights on neural networks representations in computer vision and NLP domains
  for various problems: training dynamics analysis, data distribution shift, transfer
  learning, ensemble learning, disentanglement assessment.'
