abstract: Neural network ensembles, such as Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), have
  shown success in the areas of uncertainty estimation and robustness. However, a
  crucial challenge prohibits their use in practice. BNNs require a large number of
  predictions to produce reliable results, leading to a significant increase in computational
  cost. To alleviate this issue, we propose spatial smoothing, a method that ensembles
  neighboring feature map points of convolutional neural networks. By simply adding
  a few blur layers to the models, we empirically show that spatial smoothing improves
  accuracy, uncertainty estimation, and robustness of BNNs across a whole range of
  ensemble sizes. In particular, BNNs incorporating spatial smoothing achieve high
  predictive performance merely with a handful of ensembles. Moreover, this method
  also can be applied to canonical deterministic neural networks to improve the performances.
  A number of evidences suggest that the improvements can be attributed to the stabilized
  feature maps and the smoothing of the loss landscape. In addition, we provide a
  fundamental explanation for prior works {—} namely, global average pooling, pre-activation,
  and ReLU6 {—} by addressing them as special cases of spatial smoothing. These not
  only enhance accuracy, but also improve uncertainty estimation and robustness by
  making the loss landscape smoother in the same manner as spatial smoothing. The
  code is available at https://github.com/xxxnell/spatial-smoothing.
