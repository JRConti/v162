title: Molecular Representation Learning via Heterogeneous Motif Graph Neural Networks
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We consider feature representation learning problem of molecular graphs.
  Graph Neural Networks have been widely used in feature representation learning of
  molecular graphs. However, most existing methods deal with molecular graphs individually
  while neglecting their connections, such as motif-level relationships. We propose
  a novel molecular graph representation learning method by constructing a heterogeneous
  motif graph to address this issue. In particular, we build a heterogeneous motif
  graph that contains motif nodes and molecular nodes. Each motif node corresponds
  to a motif extracted from molecules. Then, we propose a Heterogeneous Motif Graph
  Neural Network (HM-GNN) to learn feature representations for each node in the heterogeneous
  motif graph. Our heterogeneous motif graph also enables effective multi-task learning,
  especially for small molecular datasets. To address the potential efficiency issue,
  we propose to use an edge sampler, which can significantly reduce computational
  resources usage. The experimental results show that our model consistently outperforms
  previous state-of-the-art models. Under multi-task settings, the promising performances
  of our methods on combined datasets shed light on a new learning paradigm for small
  molecular datasets. Finally, we show that our model achieves similar performances
  with significantly less computational resources by using our edge sampler.
