title: Bayesian Optimization under Stochastic Delayed Feedback
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a widely-used sequential method for zeroth-order
  optimization of complex and expensive-to-compute black-box functions. The existing
  BO methods assume that the function evaluation (feedback) is available to the learner
  immediately or after a fixed delay. Such assumptions may not be practical in many
  real-life problems like online recommendations, clinical trials, and hyperparameter
  tuning where feedback is available after a random delay. To benefit from the experimental
  parallelization in these problems, the learner needs to start new function evaluations
  without waiting for delayed feedback. In this paper, we consider the BO under stochastic
  delayed feedback problem. We propose algorithms with sub-linear regret guarantees
  that efficiently address the dilemma of selecting new function queries while waiting
  for randomly delayed feedback. Building on our results, we also make novel contributions
  to batch BO and contextual Gaussian process bandits. Experiments on synthetic and
  real-life datasets verify the performance of our algorithms.
