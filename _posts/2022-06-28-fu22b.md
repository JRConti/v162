title: Greedy when Sure and Conservative when Uncertain about the Opponents
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'We develop a new approach, named Greedy when Sure and Conservative when
  Uncertain (GSCU), to competing online against unknown and nonstationary opponents.
  GSCU improves in four aspects: 1) introduces a novel way of learning opponent policy
  embeddings offline; 2) trains offline a single best response (conditional additionally
  on our opponent policy embedding) instead of a finite set of separate best responses
  against any opponent; 3) computes online a posterior of the current opponent policy
  embedding, without making the discrete and ineffective decision which type the current
  opponent belongs to; and 4) selects online between a real-time greedy policy and
  a fixed conservative policy via an adversarial bandit algorithm, gaining a theoretically
  better regret than adhering to either. Experimental studies on popular benchmarks
  demonstrate GSCUâ€™s superiority over the state-of-the-art methods. The code is available
  online at \url{https://github.com/YeTianJHU/GSCU}.'
