title: Revisiting Some Common Practices in Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Many advances in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
  are based on two common design principles: value decomposition and parameter sharing.
  A typical MARL algorithm of this fashion decomposes a centralized Q-function into
  local Q-networks with parameters shared across agents. Such an algorithmic paradigm
  enables centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) and leads to efficient
  learning in practice. Despite all the advantages, we revisit these two principles
  and show that in certain scenarios, e.g., environments with a highly multi-modal
  reward landscape, value decomposition, and parameter sharing can be problematic
  and lead to undesired outcomes. In contrast, policy gradient (PG) methods with individual
  policies provably converge to an optimal solution in these cases, which partially
  supports some recent empirical observations that PG can be effective in many MARL
  testbeds. Inspired by our theoretical analysis, we present practical suggestions
  on implementing multi-agent PG algorithms for either high rewards or diverse emergent
  behaviors and empirically validate our findings on a variety of domains, ranging
  from the simplified matrix and grid-world games to complex benchmarks such as StarCraft
  Multi-Agent Challenge and Google Research Football. We hope our insights could benefit
  the community towards developing more general and more powerful MARL algorithms.'
