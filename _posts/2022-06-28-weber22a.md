title: Certifying Out-of-Domain Generalization for Blackbox Functions
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Certifying the robustness of model performance under bounded data distribution
  drifts has recently attracted intensive interest under the umbrella of distributional
  robustness. However, existing techniques either make strong assumptions on the model
  class and loss functions that can be certified, such as smoothness expressed via
  Lipschitz continuity of gradients, or require to solve complex optimization problems.
  As a result, the wider application of these techniques is currently limited by its
  scalability and flexibility â€” these techniques often do not scale to large-scale
  datasets with modern deep neural networks or cannot handle loss functions which
  may be non-smooth such as the 0-1 loss. In this paper, we focus on the problem of
  certifying distributional robustness for blackbox models and bounded loss functions,
  and propose a novel certification framework based on the Hellinger distance. Our
  certification technique scales to ImageNet-scale datasets, complex models, and a
  diverse set of loss functions. We then focus on one specific application enabled
  by such scalability and flexibility, i.e., certifying out-of-domain generalization
  for large neural networks and loss functions such as accuracy and AUC. We experimentally
  validate our certification method on a number of datasets, ranging from ImageNet,
  where we provide the first non-vacuous certified out-of-domain generalization, to
  smaller classification tasks where we are able to compare with the state-of-the-art
  and show that our method performs considerably better.
