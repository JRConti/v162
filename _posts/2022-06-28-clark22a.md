title: Unified Scaling Laws for Routed Language Models
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'The performance of a language model has been shown to be effectively modeled
  as a power-law in its parameter count. Here we study the scaling behaviors of Routing
  Networks: architectures that conditionally use only a subset of their parameters
  while processing an input. For these models, parameter count and computational requirement
  form two independent axes along which an increase leads to better performance. In
  this work we derive and justify scaling laws defined on these two variables which
  generalize those known for standard language models and describe the performance
  of a wide range of routing architectures trained via three different techniques.
  Afterwards we provide two applications of these laws: first deriving an Effective
  Parameter Count along which all models scale at the same rate, and then using the
  scaling coefficients to give a quantitative comparison of the three routing techniques
  considered. Our analysis derives from an extensive evaluation of Routing Networks
  across five orders of magnitude of size, including models with hundreds of experts
  and hundreds of billions of parameters.'
