title: Deploying Convolutional Networks on Untrusted Platforms Using 2D Holographic
  Reduced Representations
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Due to the computational cost of running inference for a neural network,
  the need to deploy the inferential steps on a third partyâ€™s compute environment
  or hardware is common. If the third party is not fully trusted, it is desirable
  to obfuscate the nature of the inputs and outputs, so that the third party can not
  easily determine what specific task is being performed. Provably secure protocols
  for leveraging an untrusted party exist but are too computational demanding to run
  in practice. We instead explore a different strategy of fast, heuristic security
  that we call <em>Connectionist Symbolic Pseudo Secrets</em>. By leveraging Holographic
  Reduced Representations (HRRs), we create a neural network with a pseudo-encryption
  style defense that empirically shows robustness to attack, even under threat models
  that unrealistically favor the adversary.
