title: Learning from a Learning User for Optimal Recommendations
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In real-world recommendation problems, especially those with a formidably
  large item space, users have to gradually learn to estimate the utility of any fresh
  recommendations from their experience about previously consumed items. This in turn
  affects their interaction dynamics with the system and can invalidate previous algorithms
  built on the omniscient user assumption. In this paper, we formalize a model to
  capture such ”learning users” and design an efficient system-side learning solution,
  coined Noise-Robust Active Ellipsoid Search (RAES), to confront the challenges brought
  by the non-stationary feedback from such a learning user. Interestingly, we prove
  that the regret of RAES deteriorates gracefully as the convergence rate of user
  learning becomes worse, until reaching linear regret when the user’s learning fails
  to converge. Experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate the strength of RAES
  for such a contemporaneous system-user learning problem. Our study provides a novel
  perspective on modeling the feedback loop in recommendation problems.
