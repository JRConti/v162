title: Risk-Averse No-Regret Learning in Online Convex Games
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We consider an online stochastic game with risk-averse agents whose goal
  is to learn optimal decisions that minimize the risk of incurring significantly
  high costs. Specifically, we use the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) as a risk
  measure that the agents can estimate using bandit feedback in the form of the cost
  values of only their selected actions. Since the distributions of the cost functions
  depend on the actions of all agents that are generally unobservable, they are themselves
  unknown and, therefore, the CVaR values of the costs are difficult to compute. To
  address this challenge, we propose a new online risk-averse learning algorithm that
  relies on one-point zeroth-order estimation of the CVaR gradients computed using
  CVaR values that are estimated by appropriately sampling the cost functions. We
  show that this algorithm achieves sub-linear regret with high probability. We also
  propose two variants of this algorithm that improve performance. The first variant
  relies on a new sampling strategy that uses samples from the previous iteration
  to improve the estimation accuracy of the CVaR values. The second variant employs
  residual feedback that uses CVaR values from the previous iteration to reduce the
  variance of the CVaR gradient estimates. We theoretically analyze the convergence
  properties of these variants and illustrate their performance on an online market
  problem that we model as a Cournot game.
