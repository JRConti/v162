title: 'Counterfactual Transportability: A Formal Approach'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Generalizing causal knowledge across environments is a common challenge
  shared across many of the data-driven disciplines, including AI and ML. Experiments
  are usually performed in one environment (e.g., in a lab, on Earth, in a training
  ground), almost invariably, with the intent of being used elsewhere (e.g., outside
  the lab, on Mars, in the real world), in an environment that is related but somewhat
  different than the original one, where certain conditions and mechanisms are likely
  to change. This generalization task has been studied in the causal inference literature
  under the rubric of transportability (Pearl and Bareinboim, 2011). While most transportability
  works focused on generalizing associational and interventional distributions, the
  generalization of counterfactual distributions has not been formally studied. In
  this paper, we investigate the transportability of counterfactuals from an arbitrary
  combination of observational and experimental distributions coming from disparate
  domains. Specifically, we introduce a sufficient and necessary graphical condition
  and develop an efficient, sound, and complete algorithm for transporting counterfactual
  quantities across domains in nonparametric settings. Failure of the algorithm implies
  the impossibility of generalizing the target counterfactual from the available data
  without further assumptions.
