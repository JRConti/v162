title: 'PAC-Net: A Model Pruning Approach to Inductive Transfer Learning'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Inductive transfer learning aims to learn from a small amount of training
  data for the target task by utilizing a pre-trained model from the source task.
  Most strategies that involve large-scale deep learning models adopt initialization
  with the pre-trained model and fine-tuning for the target task. However, when using
  over-parameterized models, we can often prune the model without sacrificing the
  accuracy of the source task. This motivates us to adopt model pruning for transfer
  learning with deep learning models. In this paper, we propose PAC-Net, a simple
  yet effective approach for transfer learning based on pruning. PAC-Net consists
  of three steps: Prune, Allocate, and Calibrate (PAC). The main idea behind these
  steps is to identify essential weights for the source task, fine-tune on the source
  task by updating the essential weights, and then calibrate on the target task by
  updating the remaining redundant weights. Under the various and extensive set of
  inductive transfer learning experiments, we show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
  performance by a large margin.'
