title: Regularizing a Model-based Policy Stationary Distribution to Stabilize Offline
  Reinforcement Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) extends the paradigm of classical RL
  algorithms to purely learning from static datasets, without interacting with the
  underlying environment during the learning process. A key challenge of offline RL
  is the instability of policy training, caused by the mismatch between the distribution
  of the offline data and the undiscounted stationary state-action distribution of
  the learned policy. To avoid the detrimental impact of distribution mismatch, we
  regularize the undiscounted stationary distribution of the current policy towards
  the offline data during the policy optimization process. Further, we train a dynamics
  model to both implement this regularization and better estimate the stationary distribution
  of the current policy, reducing the error induced by distribution mismatch. On a
  wide range of continuous-control offline RL datasets, our method indicates competitive
  performance, which validates our algorithm. The code is publicly available.
