title: Convergence of Policy Gradient for Entropy Regularized MDPs with Neural Network
  Approximation in the Mean-Field Regime
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We study the global convergence of policy gradient for infinite-horizon,
  continuous state and action space, and entropy-regularized Markov decision processes
  (MDPs). We consider a softmax policy with (one-hidden layer) neural network approximation
  in a mean-field regime. Additional entropic regularization in the associated mean-field
  probability measure is added, and the corresponding gradient flow is studied in
  the 2-Wasserstein metric. We show that the objective function is increasing along
  the gradient flow. Further, we prove that if the regularization in terms of the
  mean-field measure is sufficient, the gradient flow converges exponentially fast
  to the unique stationary solution, which is the unique maximizer of the regularized
  MDP objective. Lastly, we study the sensitivity of the value function along the
  gradient flow with respect to regularization parameters and the initial condition.
  Our results rely on the careful analysis of the non-linear Fokker–Planck–Kolmogorov
  equation and extend the pioneering work of \cite{mei2020global} and \cite{agarwal2020optimality},
  which quantify the global convergence rate of policy gradient for entropy-regularized
  MDPs in the tabular setting.
