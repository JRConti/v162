title: On Improving Model-Free Algorithms for Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement
  Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms often suffer from an
  exponential sample complexity dependence on the number of agents, a phenomenon known
  as <em>the curse of multiagents</em>. We address this challenge by investigating
  sample-efficient model-free algorithms in <em>decentralized</em> MARL, and aim to
  improve existing algorithms along this line. For learning (coarse) correlated equilibria
  in general-sum Markov games, we propose <em>stage-based</em> V-learning algorithms
  that significantly simplify the algorithmic design and analysis of recent works,
  and circumvent a rather complicated no-<em>weighted</em>-regret bandit subroutine.
  For learning Nash equilibria in Markov potential games, we propose an independent
  policy gradient algorithm with a decentralized momentum-based variance reduction
  technique. All our algorithms are decentralized in that each agent can make decisions
  based on only its local information. Neither communication nor centralized coordination
  is required during learning, leading to a natural generalization to a large number
  of agents. Finally, we provide numerical simulations to corroborate our theoretical
  findings.
