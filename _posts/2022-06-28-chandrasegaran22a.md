  was Missing?'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'This work investigates the compatibility between label smoothing (LS) and
  knowledge distillation (KD). Contemporary findings addressing this thesis statement
  take dichotomous standpoints: Muller et al. (2019) and Shen et al. (2021b). Critically,
  there is no effort to understand and resolve these contradictory findings, leaving
  the primal question \text{-} to smooth or not to smooth a teacher network? \text{-}
  unanswered. The main contributions of our work are the discovery, analysis and validation
  of systematic diffusion as the missing concept which is instrumental in understanding
  and resolving these contradictory findings. This systematic diffusion essentially
  curtails the benefits of distilling from an LS-trained teacher, thereby rendering
  KD at increased temperatures ineffective. Our discovery is comprehensively supported
  by large-scale experiments, analyses and case studies including image classification,
  neural machine translation and compact student distillation tasks spanning across
  multiple datasets and teacher-student architectures. Based on our analysis, we suggest
  practitioners to use an LS-trained teacher with a low-temperature transfer to achieve
  high performance students. Code and models are available at https://keshik6.github.io/revisiting-ls-kd-compatibility/'
