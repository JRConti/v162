title: Anarchic Federated Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Present-day federated learning (FL) systems deployed over edge networks
  consists of a large number of workers with high degrees of heterogeneity in data
  and/or computing capabilities, which call for flexible worker participation in terms
  of timing, effort, data heterogeneity, etc. To satisfy the need for flexible worker
  participation, we consider a new FL paradigm called “Anarchic Federated Learning”
  (AFL) in this paper. In stark contrast to conventional FL models, each worker in
  AFL has the freedom to choose i) when to participate in FL, and ii) the number of
  local steps to perform in each round based on its current situation (e.g., battery
  level, communication channels, privacy concerns). However, such chaotic worker behaviors
  in AFL impose many new open questions in algorithm design. In particular, it remains
  unclear whether one could develop convergent AFL training algorithms, and if yes,
  under what conditions and how fast the achievable convergence speed is. Toward this
  end, we propose two Anarchic Federated Averaging (AFA) algorithms with two-sided
  learning rates for both cross-device and cross-silo settings, which are named AFA-CD
  and AFA-CS, respectively. Somewhat surprisingly, we show that, under mild anarchic
  assumptions, both AFL algorithms achieve the best known convergence rate as the
  state-of-the-art algorithms for conventional FL. Moreover, they retain the highly
  desirable <em>linear speedup effect</em> with respect of both the number of workers
  and local steps in the new AFL paradigm. We validate the proposed algorithms with
  extensive experiments on real-world datasets.
