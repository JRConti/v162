title: 'On the Optimization Landscape of Neural Collapse under MSE Loss: Global Optimality
  with Unconstrained Features'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: When training deep neural networks for classification tasks, an intriguing
  empirical phenomenon has been widely observed in the last-layer classifiers and
  features, where (i) the class means and the last-layer classifiers all collapse
  to the vertices of a Simplex Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) up to scaling, and (ii)
  cross-example within-class variability of last-layer activations collapses to zero.
  This phenomenon is called Neural Collapse (NC), which seems to take place regardless
  of the choice of loss functions. In this work, we justify NC under the mean squared
  error (MSE) loss, where recent empirical evidence shows that it performs comparably
  or even better than the de-facto cross-entropy loss. Under a simplified unconstrained
  feature model, we provide the first global landscape analysis for vanilla nonconvex
  MSE loss and show that the (only!) global minimizers are neural collapse solutions,
  while all other critical points are strict saddles whose Hessian exhibit negative
  curvature directions. Furthermore, we justify the usage of rescaled MSE loss by
  probing the optimization landscape around the NC solutions, showing that the landscape
  can be improved by tuning the rescaling hyperparameters. Finally, our theoretical
  findings are experimentally verified on practical network architectures.
