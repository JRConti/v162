title: Task-aware Privacy Preservation for Multi-dimensional Data
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Local differential privacy (LDP) can be adopted to anonymize richer user
  data attributes that will be input to sophisticated machine learning (ML) tasks.
  However, today’s LDP approaches are largely task-agnostic and often lead to severe
  performance loss – they simply inject noise to all data attributes according to
  a given privacy budget, regardless of what features are most relevant for the ultimate
  task. In this paper, we address how to significantly improve the ultimate task performance
  with multi-dimensional user data by considering a task-aware privacy preservation
  problem. The key idea is to use an encoder-decoder framework to learn (and anonymize)
  a task-relevant latent representation of user data. We obtain an analytical near-optimal
  solution for the linear setting with mean-squared error (MSE) task loss. We also
  provide an approximate solution through a gradient-based learning algorithm for
  general nonlinear cases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our task-aware approach
  significantly improves ultimate task accuracy compared to standard benchmark LDP
  approaches with the same level of privacy guarantee.
