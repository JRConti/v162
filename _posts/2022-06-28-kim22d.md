title: 'Guided-TTS: A Diffusion Model for Text-to-Speech via Classifier Guidance'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We propose Guided-TTS, a high-quality text-to-speech (TTS) model that does
  not require any transcript of target speaker using classifier guidance. Guided-TTS
  combines an unconditional diffusion probabilistic model with a separately trained
  phoneme classifier for classifier guidance. Our unconditional diffusion model learns
  to generate speech without any context from untranscribed speech data. For TTS synthesis,
  we guide the generative process of the diffusion model with a phoneme classifier
  trained on a large-scale speech recognition dataset. We present a norm-based scaling
  method that reduces the pronunciation errors of classifier guidance in Guided-TTS.
  We show that Guided-TTS achieves a performance comparable to that of the state-of-the-art
  TTS model, Grad-TTS, without any transcript for LJSpeech. We further demonstrate
  that Guided-TTS performs well on diverse datasets including a long-form untranscribed
  dataset.
