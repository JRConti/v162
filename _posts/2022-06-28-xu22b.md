title: Learning to Separate Voices by Spatial Regions
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'We consider the problem of audio voice separation for binaural applications,
  such as earphones and hearing aids. While today’s neural networks perform remarkably
  well (separating 4+ sources with 2 microphones) they assume a known or fixed maximum
  number of sources, K. Moreover, today’s models are trained in a supervised manner,
  using training data synthesized from generic sources, environments, and human head
  shapes. This paper intends to relax both these constraints at the expense of a slight
  alteration in the problem definition. We observe that, when a received mixture contains
  too many sources, it is still helpful to separate them by region, i.e., isolating
  signal mixtures from each conical sector around the user’s head. This requires learning
  the fine-grained spatial properties of each region, including the signal distortions
  imposed by a person’s head. We propose a two-stage self-supervised framework in
  which overheard voices from earphones are pre-processed to extract relatively clean
  personalized signals, which are then used to train a region-wise separation model.
  Results show promising performance, underscoring the importance of personalization
  over a generic supervised approach. (audio samples available at our project website:
  https://uiuc-earable-computing.github.io/binaural). We believe this result could
  help real-world applications in selective hearing, noise cancellation, and audio
  augmented reality.'
