title: Neural Network Pruning Denoises the Features and Makes Local Connectivity Emerge
  in Visual Tasks
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Pruning methods can considerably reduce the size of artificial neural networks
  without harming their performance and in some cases they can even uncover sub-networks
  that, when trained in isolation, match or surpass the test accuracy of their dense
  counterparts. Here, we characterize the inductive bias that pruning imprints in
  such "winning lottery tickets": focusing on visual tasks, we analyze the architecture
  resulting from iterative magnitude pruning of a simple fully connected network.
  We show that the surviving node connectivity is local in input space, and organized
  in patterns reminiscent of the ones found in convolutional networks. We investigate
  the role played by data and tasks in shaping the architecture of the pruned sub-network.
  We find that pruning performances, and the ability to sift out the noise and make
  local features emerge, improve by increasing the size of the training set, and the
  semantic value of the data. We also study different pruning procedures, and find
  that iterative magnitude pruning is particularly effective in distilling meaningful
  connectivity out of features present in the original task. Our results suggest the
  possibility to automatically discover new and efficient architectural inductive
  biases in other datasets and tasks.'
