title: Convolutional and Residual Networks Provably Contain Lottery Tickets
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis continues to have a profound practical impact
  on the quest for small scale deep neural networks that solve modern deep learning
  tasks at competitive performance. These lottery tickets are identified by pruning
  large randomly initialized neural networks with architectures that are as diverse
  as their applications. Yet, theoretical insights that attest their existence have
  been mostly focused on deed fully-connected feed forward networks with ReLU activation
  functions. We prove that also modern architectures consisting of convolutional and
  residual layers that can be equipped with almost arbitrary activation functions
  can contain lottery tickets with high probability.
