abstract: 'An ideal learned representation should display transferability and robustness.
  Supervised contrastive learning (SupCon) is a promising method for training accurate
  models, but produces representations that do not capture these properties due to
  class collapseâ€”when all points in a class map to the same representation. Recent
  work suggests that "spreading out" these representations improves them, but the
  precise mechanism is poorly understood. We argue that creating spread alone is insufficient
  for better representations, since spread is invariant to permutations within classes.
  Instead, both the correct degree of spread and a mechanism for breaking this invariance
  are necessary. We first prove that adding a weighted class-conditional InfoNCE loss
  to SupCon controls the degree of spread. Next, we study three mechanisms to break
  permutation invariance: using a constrained encoder, adding a class-conditional
  autoencoder, and using data augmentation. We show that the latter two encourage
  clustering of latent subclasses under more realistic conditions than the former.
  Using these insights, we show that adding a properly-weighted class-conditional
  InfoNCE loss and a class-conditional autoencoder to SupCon achieves 11.1 points
  of lift on coarse-to-fine transfer across 5 standard datasets and 4.7 points on
  worst-group robustness on 3 datasets, setting state-of-the-art on CelebA by 11.5
  points.'
