  Online Reinforcement Learning'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In view of its power in extracting feature representation, contrastive self-supervised
  learning has been successfully integrated into the practice of (deep) reinforcement
  learning (RL), leading to efficient policy learning on various applications. Despite
  its tremendous empirical successes, the understanding of contrastive learning for
  RL remains elusive. To narrow such a gap, we study contrastive-learning empowered
  RL for a class of Markov decision processes (MDPs) and Markov games (MGs) with low-rank
  transitions. For both models, we propose to extract the correct feature representations
  of the low-rank model by minimizing a contrastive loss. Moreover, under the online
  setting, we propose novel upper confidence bound (UCB)-type algorithms that incorporate
  such a contrastive loss with online RL algorithms for MDPs or MGs. We further theoretically
  prove that our algorithm recovers the true representations and simultaneously achieves
  sample efficiency in learning the optimal policy and Nash equilibrium in MDPs and
  MGs. We also provide empirical studies to demonstrate the efficacy of the UCB-based
  contrastive learning method for RL. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the
  first provably efficient online RL algorithm that incorporates contrastive learning
  for representation learning.
