title: 'data2vec: A General Framework for Self-supervised Learning in Speech, Vision
  and Language'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: While the general idea of self-supervised learning is identical across modalities,
  the actual algorithms and objectives differ widely because they were developed with
  a single modality in mind. To get us closer to general self-supervised learning,
  we present data2vec, a framework that uses the same learning method for either speech,
  NLP or computer vision. The core idea is to predict latent representations of the
  full input data based on a masked view of the input in a self-distillation setup
  using a standard Transformer architecture. Instead of predicting modality-specific
  targets such as words, visual tokens or units of human speech which are local in
  nature, data2vec predicts contextualized latent representations that contain information
  from the entire input. Experiments on the major benchmarks of speech recognition,
  image classification, and natural language understanding demonstrate a new state
  of the art or competitive performance to predominant approaches.
