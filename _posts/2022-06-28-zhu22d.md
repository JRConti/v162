title: Topology-aware Generalization of Decentralized SGD
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: This paper studies the algorithmic stability and generalizability of decentralized
  stochastic gradient descent (D-SGD). We prove that the consensus model learned by
  D-SGD is $\mathcal{O}{(m/N\unaryplus1/m\unaryplus\lambda^2)}$-stable in expectation
  in the non-convex non-smooth setting, where $N$ is the total sample size of the
  whole system, $m$ is the worker number, and $1\unaryminus\lambda$ is the spectral
  gap that measures the connectivity of the communication topology. These results
  then deliver an $\mathcal{O}{(1/N\unaryplus{({(m^{-1}\lambda^2)}^{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\unaryplus
  m^{\unaryminus\alpha})}/{N^{1\unaryminus\frac{\alpha}{2}}})}$ in-average generalization
  bound, which is non-vacuous even when $\lambda$ is closed to $1$, in contrast to
  vacuous as suggested by existing literature on the projected version of D-SGD. Our
  theory indicates that the generalizability of D-SGD has a positive correlation with
  the spectral gap, and can explain why consensus control in initial training phase
  can ensure better generalization. Experiments of VGG-11 and ResNet-18 on CIFAR-10,
  CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet justify our theory. To our best knowledge, this is the
  first work on the topology-aware generalization of vanilla D-SGD. Code is available
