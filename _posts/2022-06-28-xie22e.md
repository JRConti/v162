title: Self-Supervised Representation Learning via Latent Graph Prediction
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) of graph neural networks is emerging as a
  promising way of leveraging unlabeled data. Currently, most methods are based on
  contrastive learning adapted from the image domain, which requires view generation
  and a sufficient number of negative samples. In contrast, existing predictive models
  do not require negative sampling, but lack theoretical guidance on the design of
  pretext training tasks. In this work, we propose the LaGraph, a theoretically grounded
  predictive SSL framework based on latent graph prediction. Learning objectives of
  LaGraph are derived as self-supervised upper bounds to objectives for predicting
  unobserved latent graphs. In addition to its improved performance, LaGraph provides
  explanations for recent successes of predictive models that include invariance-based
  objectives. We provide theoretical analysis comparing LaGraph to related methods
  in different domains. Our experimental results demonstrate the superiority of LaGraph
  in performance and the robustness to decreasing of training sample size on both
  graph-level and node-level tasks.
