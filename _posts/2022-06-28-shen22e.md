title: Constrained Optimization with Dynamic Bound-scaling for Effective NLP Backdoor
  Defense
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Modern language models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. An injected
  malicious token sequence (i.e., a trigger) can cause the compromised model to misbehave,
  raising security concerns. Trigger inversion is a widely-used technique for scanning
  backdoors in vision models. It can- not be directly applied to NLP models due to
  their discrete nature. In this paper, we develop a novel optimization method for
  NLP backdoor inversion. We leverage a dynamically reducing temperature coefficient
  in the softmax function to provide changing loss landscapes to the optimizer such
  that the process gradually focuses on the ground truth trigger, which is denoted
  as a one-hot value in a convex hull. Our method also features a temperature rollback
  mechanism to step away from local optimals, exploiting the observation that local
  optimals can be easily determined in NLP trigger inversion (while not in general
  optimization). We evaluate the technique on over 1600 models (with roughly half
  of them having injected backdoors) on 3 prevailing NLP tasks, with 4 different backdoor
  attacks and 7 architectures. Our results show that the technique is able to effectively
  and efficiently detect and remove backdoors, outperforming 5 baseline methods. The
  code is available at https: //github.com/PurduePAML/DBS.'
