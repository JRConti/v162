title: 'PAGE-PG: A Simple and Loopless Variance-Reduced Policy Gradient Method with
  Probabilistic Gradient Estimation'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Despite their success, policy gradient methods suffer from high variance
  of the gradient estimator, which can result in unsatisfactory sample complexity.
  Recently, numerous variance-reduced extensions of policy gradient methods with provably
  better sample complexity and competitive numerical performance have been proposed.
  After a compact survey on some of the main variance-reduced REINFORCE-type methods,
  we propose ProbAbilistic Gradient Estimation for Policy Gradient (PAGE-PG), a novel
  loopless variance-reduced policy gradient method based on a probabilistic switch
  between two types of update. Our method is inspired by the PAGE estimator for supervised
  learning and leverages importance sampling to obtain an unbiased gradient estimator.
  We show that PAGE-PG enjoys a $\mathcal{O}\left( \epsilon^{-3} \right)$ average
  sample complexity to reach an $\epsilon$-stationary solution, which matches the
  sample complexity of its most competitive counterparts under the same setting. A
  numerical evaluation confirms the competitive performance of our method on classical
  control tasks.
