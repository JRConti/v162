title: Learning General Halfspaces with Adversarial Label Noise via Online Gradient
  Descent
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We study the problem of learning general {—} i.e., not necessarily homogeneous
  {—} halfspaces with adversarial label noise under the Gaussian distribution. Prior
  work has provided a sophisticated polynomial-time algorithm for this problem. In
  this work, we show that the problem can be solved directly via online gradient descent
  applied to a sequence of natural non-convex surrogates. This approach yields a simple
  iterative learning algorithm for general halfspaces with near-optimal sample complexity,
  runtime, and error guarantee. At the conceptual level, our work establishes an intriguing
  connection between learning halfspaces with adversarial noise and online optimization
  that may find other applications.
