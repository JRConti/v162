title: Diversified Adversarial Attacks based on Conjugate Gradient Method
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Deep learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, and adversarial
  attacks used to generate such examples have attracted considerable research interest.
  Although existing methods based on the steepest descent have achieved high attack
  success rates, ill-conditioned problems occasionally reduce their performance. To
  address this limitation, we utilize the conjugate gradient (CG) method, which is
  effective for this type of problem, and propose a novel attack algorithm inspired
  by the CG method, named the Auto Conjugate Gradient (ACG) attack. The results of
  large-scale evaluation experiments conducted on the latest robust models show that,
  for most models, ACG was able to find more adversarial examples with fewer iterations
  than the existing SOTA algorithm Auto-PGD (APGD). We investigated the difference
  in search performance between ACG and APGD in terms of diversification and intensification,
  and define a measure called Diversity Index (DI) to quantify the degree of diversity.
  From the analysis of the diversity using this index, we show that the more diverse
  search of the proposed method remarkably improves its attack success rate.
