title: Modeling Structure with Undirected Neural Networks
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Neural networks are powerful function estimators, leading to their status
  as a paradigm of choice for modeling structured data. However, unlike other structured
  representations that emphasize the modularity of the problem {–} e.g., factor graphs
  {–} neural networks are usually monolithic mappings from inputs to outputs, with
  a fixed computation order. This limitation prevents them from capturing different
  directions of computation and interaction between the modeled variables. In this
  paper, we combine the representational strengths of factor graphs and of neural
  networks, proposing undirected neural networks (UNNs): a flexible framework for
  specifying computations that can be performed in any order. For particular choices,
  our proposed models subsume and extend many existing architectures: feed-forward,
  recurrent, self-attention networks, auto-encoders, and networks with implicit layers.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of undirected neural architectures, both unstructured
  and structured, on a range of tasks: tree-constrained dependency parsing, convolutional
  image classification, and sequence completion with attention. By varying the computation
  order, we show how a single UNN can be used both as a classifier and a prototype
  generator, and how it can fill in missing parts of an input sequence, making them
  a promising field for further research.'
