title: 'Functional Output Regression with Infimal Convolution: Exploring the Huber
  and $ε$-insensitive Losses'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The focus of the paper is functional output regression (FOR) with convoluted
  losses. While most existing work consider the square loss setting, we leverage extensions
  of the Huber and the $\epsilon$-insensitive loss (induced by infimal convolution)
  and propose a flexible framework capable of handling various forms of outliers and
  sparsity in the FOR family. We derive computationally tractable algorithms relying
  on duality to tackle the resulting tasks in the context of vector-valued reproducing
  kernel Hilbert spaces. The efficiency of the approach is demonstrated and contrasted
  with the classical squared loss setting on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks.
