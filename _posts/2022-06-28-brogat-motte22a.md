title: Learning to Predict Graphs with Fused Gromov-Wasserstein Barycenters
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: This paper introduces a novel and generic framework to solve the flagship
  task of supervised labeled graph prediction by leveraging Optimal Transport tools.
  We formulate the problem as regression with the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) loss
  and propose a predictive model relying on a FGW barycenter whose weights depend
  on inputs. First we introduce a non-parametric estimator based on kernel ridge regression
  for which theoretical results such as consistency and excess risk bound are proved.
  Next we propose an interpretable parametric model where the barycenter weights are
  modeled with a neural network and the graphs on which the FGW barycenter is calculated
  are additionally learned. Numerical experiments show the strength of the method
  and its ability to interpolate in the labeled graph space on simulated data and
  on a difficult metabolic identification problem where it can reach very good performance
  with very little engineering.
