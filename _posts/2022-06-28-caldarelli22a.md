title: Adaptive Gaussian Process Change Point Detection
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Detecting change points in time series, i.e., points in time at which some
  observed process suddenly changes, is a fundamental task that arises in many real-world
  applications, with consequences for safety and reliability. In this work, we propose
  ADAGA, a novel Gaussian process-based solution to this problem, that leverages a
  powerful heuristics we developed based on statistical hypothesis testing. In contrast
  to prior approaches, ADAGA adapts to changes both in mean and covariance structure
  of the temporal process. In extensive experiments, we show its versatility and applicability
  to different classes of change points, demonstrating that it is significantly more
  accurate than current state-of-the-art alternatives.
