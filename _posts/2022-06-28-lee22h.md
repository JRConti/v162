title: Query-Efficient and Scalable Black-Box Adversarial Attacks on Discrete Sequential
  Data via Bayesian Optimization
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We focus on the problem of adversarial attacks against models on discrete
  sequential data in the black-box setting where the attacker aims to craft adversarial
  examples with limited query access to the victim model. Existing black-box attacks,
  mostly based on greedy algorithms, find adversarial examples using pre-computed
  key positions to perturb, which severely limits the search space and might result
  in suboptimal solutions. To this end, we propose a query-efficient black-box attack
  using Bayesian optimization, which dynamically computes important positions using
  an automatic relevance determination (ARD) categorical kernel. We introduce block
  decomposition and history subsampling techniques to improve the scalability of Bayesian
  optimization when an input sequence becomes long. Moreover, we develop a post-optimization
  algorithm that finds adversarial examples with smaller perturbation size. Experiments
  on natural language and protein classification tasks demonstrate that our method
  consistently achieves higher attack success rate with significant reduction in query
  count and modification rate compared to the previous state-of-the-art methods.
