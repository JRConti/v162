  Perspective'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Recent works have examined theoretical and empirical properties of wide
  neural networks trained in the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regime. Given that biological
  neural networks are much wider than their artificial counterparts, we consider NTK
  regime wide neural networks as a possible model of biological neural networks. Leveraging
  NTK theory, we show theoretically that gradient descent drives layerwise weight
  updates that are aligned with their input activity correlations weighted by error,
  and demonstrate empirically that the result also holds in finite-width wide networks.
  The alignment result allows us to formulate a family of biologically-motivated,
  backpropagation-free learning rules that are theoretically equivalent to backpropagation
  in infinite-width networks. We test these learning rules on benchmark problems in
  feedforward and recurrent neural networks and demonstrate, in wide networks, comparable
  performance to backpropagation. The proposed rules are particularly effective in
  low data regimes, which are common in biological learning settings.
