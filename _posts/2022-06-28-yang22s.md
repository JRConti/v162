title: Identity-Disentangled Adversarial Augmentation for Self-supervised Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Data augmentation is critical to contrastive self-supervised learning, whose
  goal is to distinguish a sample’s augmentations (positives) from other samples (negatives).
  However, strong augmentations may change the sample-identity of the positives, while
  weak augmentation produces easy positives/negatives leading to nearly-zero loss
  and ineffective learning. In this paper, we study a simple adversarial augmentation
  method that can modify training data to be hard positives/negatives without distorting
  the key information about their original identities. In particular, we decompose
  a sample $x$ to be its variational auto-encoder (VAE) reconstruction $G(x)$ plus
  the residual $R(x)=x-G(x)$, where $R(x)$ retains most identity-distinctive information
  due to an information-theoretic interpretation of the VAE objective. We then adversarially
  perturb $G(x)$ in the VAE’s bottleneck space and adds it back to the original $R(x)$
  as an augmentation, which is therefore sufficiently challenging for contrastive
  learning and meanwhile preserves the sample identity intact. We apply this “identity-disentangled
  adversarial augmentation (IDAA)” to different self-supervised learning methods.
  On multiple benchmark datasets, IDAA consistently improves both their efficiency
  and generalization performance. We further show that IDAA learned on a dataset can
  be transferred to other datasets. Code is available at \href{https://github.com/kai-wen-yang/IDAA}{https://github.com/kai-wen-yang/IDAA}.
