title: Generalised Policy Improvement with Geometric Policy Composition
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We introduce a method for policy improvement that interpolates between the
  greedy approach of value-based reinforcement learning (RL) and the full planning
  approach typical of model-based RL. The new method builds on the concept of a geometric
  horizon model (GHM, also known as a \gamma-model), which models the discounted state-visitation
  distribution of a given policy. We show that we can evaluate any non-Markov policy
  that switches between a set of base Markov policies with fixed probability by a
  careful composition of the base policy GHMs, without any additional learning. We
  can then apply generalised policy improvement (GPI) to collections of such non-Markov
  policies to obtain a new Markov policy that will in general outperform its precursors.
  We provide a thorough theoretical analysis of this approach, develop applications
  to transfer and standard RL, and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness over
  standard GPI on a challenging deep RL continuous control task. We also provide an
  analysis of GHM training methods, proving a novel convergence result regarding previously
  proposed methods and showing how to train these models stably in deep RL settings.
