title: 'GALAXY: Graph-based Active Learning at the Extreme'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Active learning is a label-efficient approach to train highly effective
  models while interactively selecting only small subsets of unlabelled data for labelling
  and training. In “open world" settings, the classes of interest can make up a small
  fraction of the overall dataset – most of the data may be viewed as an out-of-distribution
  or irrelevant class. This leads to extreme class-imbalance, and our theory and methods
  focus on this core issue. We propose a new strategy for active learning called GALAXY
  (Graph-based Active Learning At the eXtrEme), which blends ideas from graph-based
  active learning and deep learning. GALAXY automatically and adaptively selects more
  class-balanced examples for labeling than most other methods for active learning.
  Our theory shows that GALAXY performs a refined form of uncertainty sampling that
  gathers a much more class-balanced dataset than vanilla uncertainty sampling. Experimentally,
  we demonstrate GALAXY’s superiority over existing state-of-art deep active learning
  algorithms in unbalanced vision classification settings generated from popular datasets.
