title: Data Determines Distributional Robustness in Contrastive Language Image Pre-training
  (CLIP)
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Contrastively trained language-image models such as CLIP, ALIGN, and BASIC
  have demonstrated unprecedented robustness to multiple challenging natural distribution
  shifts. Since these language-image models differ from previous training approaches
  in several ways, an important question is what causes the large robustness gains.
  We answer this question via a systematic experimental investigation. Concretely,
  we study five different possible causes for the robustness gains: (i) the training
  set size, (ii) the training distribution, (iii) language supervision at training
  time, (iv) language supervision at test time, and (v) the contrastive loss function.
  Our experiments show that the more diverse training distribution is the main cause
  for the robustness gains, with the other factors contributing little to no robustness.
  Beyond our experimental results, we also introduce ImageNet-Captions, a version
  of ImageNet with original text annotations from Flickr, to enable further controlled
  experiments of language-image training.'
