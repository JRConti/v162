title: 'G-Mixup: Graph Data Augmentation for Graph Classification'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'This work develops mixup for graph data. Mixup has shown superiority in
  improving the generalization and robustness of neural networks by interpolating
  features and labels between two random samples. Traditionally, Mixup can work on
  regular, grid-like, and Euclidean data such as image or tabular data. However, it
  is challenging to directly adopt Mixup to augment graph data because different graphs
  typically: 1) have different numbers of nodes; 2) are not readily aligned; and 3)
  have unique typologies in non-Euclidean space. To this end, we propose G-Mixup to
  augment graphs for graph classification by interpolating the generator (i.e., graphon)
  of different classes of graphs. Specifically, we first use graphs within the same
  class to estimate a graphon. Then, instead of directly manipulating graphs, we interpolate
  graphons of different classes in the Euclidean space to get mixed graphons, where
  the synthetic graphs are generated through sampling based on the mixed graphons.
  Extensive experiments show that G-Mixup substantially improves the generalization
  and robustness of GNNs.'
