title: A New Perspective on the Effects of Spectrum in Graph Neural Networks
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Many improvements on GNNs can be deemed as operations on the spectrum of
  the underlying graph matrix, which motivates us to directly study the characteristics
  of the spectrum and their effects on GNN performance. By generalizing most existing
  GNN architectures, we show that the correlation issue caused by the unsmooth spectrum
  becomes the obstacle to leveraging more powerful graph filters as well as developing
  deep architectures, which therefore restricts GNNsâ€™ performance. Inspired by this,
  we propose the correlation-free architecture which naturally removes the correlation
  issue among different channels, making it possible to utilize more sophisticated
  filters within each channel. The final correlation-free architecture with more powerful
  filters consistently boosts the performance of learning graph representations. Code
  is available at https://github.com/qslim/gnn-spectrum.
