title: Accelerated Federated Learning with Decoupled Adaptive Optimization
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The federated learning (FL) framework enables edge clients to collaboratively
  learn a shared inference model while keeping privacy of training data on clients.
  Recently, many heuristics efforts have been made to generalize centralized adaptive
  optimization methods, such as SGDM, Adam, AdaGrad, etc., to federated settings for
  improving convergence and accuracy. However, there is still a paucity of theoretical
  principles on where to and how to design and utilize adaptive optimization methods
  in federated settings. This work aims to develop novel adaptive optimization methods
  for FL from the perspective of dynamics of ordinary differential equations (ODEs).
  First, an analytic framework is established to build a connection between federated
  optimization methods and decompositions of ODEs of corresponding centralized optimizers.
  Second, based on this analytic framework, a momentum decoupling adaptive optimization
  method, FedDA, is developed to fully utilize the global momentum on each local iteration
  and accelerate the training convergence. Last but not least, full batch gradients
  are utilized to mimic centralized optimization in the end of the training process
  to ensure the convergence and overcome the possible inconsistency caused by adaptive
  optimization methods.
