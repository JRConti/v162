title: Implicit Regularization with Polynomial Growth in Deep Tensor Factorization
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We study the implicit regularization effects of deep learning in tensor
  factorization. While implicit regularization in deep matrix and ’shallow’ tensor
  factorization via linear and certain type of non-linear neural networks promotes
  low-rank solutions with at most quadratic growth, we show that its effect in deep
  tensor factorization grows polynomially with the depth of the network. This provides
  a remarkably faithful description of the observed experimental behaviour. Using
  numerical experiments, we demonstrate the benefits of this implicit regularization
  in yielding a more accurate estimation and better convergence properties.
