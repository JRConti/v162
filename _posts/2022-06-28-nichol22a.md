title: 'GLIDE: Towards Photorealistic Image Generation and Editing with Text-Guided
  Diffusion Models'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Diffusion models have recently been shown to generate high-quality synthetic
  images, especially when paired with a guidance technique to trade off diversity
  for fidelity. We explore diffusion models for the problem of text-conditional image
  synthesis and compare two different guidance strategies: CLIP guidance and classifier-free
  guidance. We find that the latter is preferred by human evaluators for both photorealism
  and caption similarity, and often produces photorealistic samples. Samples from
  a 3.5Â billion parameter text-conditional diffusion model using classifier-free guidance
  are favored by human evaluators to those from DALL-E, even when the latter uses
  expensive CLIP reranking. Additionally, we find that our models can be fine-tuned
  to perform image inpainting, enabling powerful text-driven image editing. We train
  a smaller model on a filtered dataset and release the code and weights at https://github.com/openai/glide-text2im.'
