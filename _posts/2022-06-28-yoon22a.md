title: Bitwidth Heterogeneous Federated Learning with Progressive Weight Dequantization
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In practical federated learning scenarios, the participating devices may
  have different bitwidths for computation and memory storage by design. However,
  despite the progress made in device-heterogeneous federated learning scenarios,
  the heterogeneity in the bitwidth specifications in the hardware has been mostly
  overlooked. We introduce a pragmatic FL scenario with bitwidth heterogeneity across
  the participating devices, dubbed as Bitwidth Heterogeneous Federated Learning (BHFL).
  BHFL brings in a new challenge, that the aggregation of model parameters with different
  bitwidths could result in severe performance degeneration, especially for high-bitwidth
  models. To tackle this problem, we propose ProWD framework, which has a trainable
  weight dequantizer at the central server that progressively reconstructs the low-bitwidth
  weights into higher bitwidth weights, and finally into full-precision weights. ProWD
  further selectively aggregates the model parameters to maximize the compatibility
  across bit-heterogeneous weights. We validate ProWD against relevant FL baselines
  on the benchmark datasets, using clients with varying bitwidths. Our ProWD largely
  outperforms the baseline FL algorithms as well as naive approaches (e.g. grouped
  averaging) under the proposed BHFL scenario.
