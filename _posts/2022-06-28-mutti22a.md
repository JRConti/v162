title: The Importance of Non-Markovianity in Maximum State Entropy Exploration
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In the maximum state entropy exploration framework, an agent interacts with
  a reward-free environment to learn a policy that maximizes the entropy of the expected
  state visitations it is inducing. Hazan et al. (2019) noted that the class of Markovian
  stochastic policies is sufficient for the maximum state entropy objective, and exploiting
  non-Markovianity is generally considered pointless in this setting. In this paper,
  we argue that non-Markovianity is instead paramount for maximum state entropy exploration
  in a finite-sample regime. Especially, we recast the objective to target the expected
  entropy of the induced state visitations in a single trial. Then, we show that the
  class of non-Markovian deterministic policies is sufficient for the introduced objective,
  while Markovian policies suffer non-zero regret in general. However, we prove that
  the problem of finding an optimal non-Markovian policy is NP-hard. Despite this
  negative result, we discuss avenues to address the problem in a tractable way and
  how non-Markovian exploration could benefit the sample efficiency of online reinforcement
  learning in future works.
