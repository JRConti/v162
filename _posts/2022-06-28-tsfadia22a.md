title: 'FriendlyCore: Practical Differentially Private Aggregation'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Differentially private algorithms for common metric aggregation tasks, such
  as clustering or averaging, often have limited practicality due to their complexity
  or to the large number of data points that is required for accurate results. We
  propose a simple and practical tool $\mathsf{FriendlyCore}$ that takes a set of
  points ${\cal D}$ from an unrestricted (pseudo) metric space as input. When ${\cal
  D}$ has effective diameter $r$, $\mathsf{FriendlyCore}$ returns a “stable” subset
  ${\cal C} \subseteq {\cal D}$ that includes all points, except possibly few outliers,
  and is <em>guaranteed</em> to have diameter $r$. $\mathsf{FriendlyCore}$ can be
  used to preprocess the input before privately aggregating it, potentially simplifying
  the aggregation or boosting its accuracy. Surprisingly, $\mathsf{FriendlyCore}$
  is light-weight with no dependence on the dimension. We empirically demonstrate
  its advantages in boosting the accuracy of mean estimation and clustering tasks
  such as $k$-means and $k$-GMM, outperforming tailored methods.
