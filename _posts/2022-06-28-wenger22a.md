title: Preconditioning for Scalable Gaussian Process Hyperparameter Optimization
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Gaussian process hyperparameter optimization requires linear solves with,
  and log-determinants of, large kernel matrices. Iterative numerical techniques are
  becoming popular to scale to larger datasets, relying on the conjugate gradient
  method (CG) for the linear solves and stochastic trace estimation for the log-determinant.
  This work introduces new algorithmic and theoretical insights for preconditioning
  these computations. While preconditioning is well understood in the context of CG,
  we demonstrate that it can also accelerate convergence and reduce variance of the
  estimates for the log-determinant and its derivative. We prove general probabilistic
  error bounds for the preconditioned computation of the log-determinant, log-marginal
  likelihood and its derivatives. Additionally, we derive specific rates for a range
  of kernel-preconditioner combinations, showing that up to exponential convergence
  can be achieved. Our theoretical results enable provably efficient optimization
  of kernel hyperparameters, which we validate empirically on large-scale benchmark
  problems. There our approach accelerates training by up to an order of magnitude.
