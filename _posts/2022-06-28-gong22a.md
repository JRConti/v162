title: 'RankSim: Ranking Similarity Regularization for Deep Imbalanced Regression'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Data imbalance, in which a plurality of the data samples come from a small
  proportion of labels, poses a challenge in training deep neural networks. Unlike
  classification, in regression the labels are continuous, potentially boundless,
  and form a natural ordering. These distinct features of regression call for new
  techniques that leverage the additional information encoded in label-space relationships.
  This paper presents the RankSim (ranking similarity) regularizer for deep imbalanced
  regression, which encodes an inductive bias that samples that are closer in label
  space should also be closer in feature space. In contrast to recent distribution
  smoothing based approaches, RankSim captures both nearby and distant relationships:
  for a given data sample, RankSim encourages the sorted list of its neighbors in
  label space to match the sorted list of its neighbors in feature space. RankSim
  is complementary to conventional imbalanced learning techniques, including re-weighting,
  two-stage training, and distribution smoothing, and lifts the state-of-the-art performance
  on three imbalanced regression benchmarks: IMDB-WIKI-DIR, AgeDB-DIR, and STS-B-DIR.'
