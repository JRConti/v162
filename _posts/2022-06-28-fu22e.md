title: "$p$-Laplacian Based Graph Neural Networks"
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated superior performance for
  semi-supervised node classification on graphs, as a result of their ability to exploit
  node features and topological information simultaneously. However, most GNNs implicitly
  assume that the labels of nodes and their neighbors in a graph are the same or consistent,
  which does not hold in heterophilic graphs, where the labels of linked nodes are
  likely to differ. Moreover, when the topology is non-informative for label prediction,
  ordinary GNNs may work significantly worse than simply applying multi-layer perceptrons
  (MLPs) on each node. To tackle the above problem, we propose a new $p$-Laplacian
  based GNN model, termed as $^p$GNN, whose message passing mechanism is derived from
  a discrete regularization framework and could be theoretically explained as an approximation
  of a polynomial graph filter defined on the spectral domain of $p$-Laplacians. The
  spectral analysis shows that the new message passing mechanism works as low-high-pass
  filters, thus making $^p$GNNs are effective on both homophilic and heterophilic
  graphs. Empirical studies on real-world and synthetic datasets validate our findings
  and demonstrate that $^p$GNNs significantly outperform several state-of-the-art
  GNN architectures on heterophilic benchmarks while achieving competitive performance
  on homophilic benchmarks. Moreover, $^p$GNNs can adaptively learn aggregation weights
  and are robust to noisy edges.
