title: Lie Point Symmetry Data Augmentation for Neural PDE Solvers
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Neural networks are increasingly being used to solve partial differential
  equations (PDEs), replacing slower numerical solvers. However, a critical issue
  is that neural PDE solvers require high-quality ground truth data, which usually
  must come from the very solvers they are designed to replace. Thus, we are presented
  with a proverbial chicken-and-egg problem. In this paper, we present a method, which
  can partially alleviate this problem, by improving neural PDE solver sample complexityâ€”Lie
  point symmetry data augmentation (LPSDA). In the context of PDEs, it turns out we
  are able to quantitatively derive an exhaustive list of data transformations, based
  on the Lie point symmetry group of the PDEs in question, something not possible
  in other application areas. We present this framework and demonstrate how it can
  easily be deployed to improve neural PDE solver sample complexity by an order of
  magnitude.
