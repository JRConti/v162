title: Offline RL Policies Should Be Trained to be Adaptive
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Offline RL algorithms must account for the fact that the dataset they are
  provided may leave many facets of the environment unknown. The most common way to
  approach this challenge is to employ pessimistic or conservative methods, which
  avoid behaviors that are too dissimilar from those in the training dataset. However,
  relying exclusively on conservatism has drawbacks: performance is sensitive to the
  exact degree of conservatism, and conservative objectives can recover highly suboptimal
  policies. In this work, we propose that offline RL methods should instead be adaptive
  in the presence of uncertainty. We show that acting optimally in offline RL in a
  Bayesian sense involves solving an implicit POMDP. As a result, optimal policies
  for offline RL must be adaptive, depending not just on the current state but rather
  all the transitions seen so far during evaluation. We present a model-free algorithm
  for approximating this optimal adaptive policy, and demonstrate the efficacy of
  learning such adaptive policies in offline RL benchmarks.'
