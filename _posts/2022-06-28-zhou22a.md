title: Dimension-free Complexity Bounds for High-order Nonconvex Finite-sum Optimization
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Stochastic high-order methods for finding first-order stationary points
  in nonconvex finite-sum optimization have witnessed increasing interest in recent
  years, and various upper and lower bounds of the oracle complexity have been proved.
  However, under standard regularity assumptions, existing complexity bounds are all
  dimension-dependent (e.g., polylogarithmic dependence), which contrasts with the
  dimension-free complexity bounds for stochastic first-order methods and deterministic
  high-order methods. In this paper, we show that the polylogarithmic dimension dependence
  gap is not essential and can be closed. More specifically, we propose stochastic
  high-order algorithms with novel first-order and high-order derivative estimators,
  which can achieve dimension-free complexity bounds. With the access to $p$-th order
  derivatives of the objective function, we prove that our algorithm finds $\epsilon$-stationary
  points with $O(n^{(2p-1)/(2p)}/\epsilon^{(p+1)/p})$ high-order oracle complexities,
  where $n$ is the number of individual functions. Our result strictly improves the
  complexity bounds of existing high-order deterministic methods with respect to the
  dependence on $n$, and it is dimension-free compared with existing stochastic high-order
  methods.
