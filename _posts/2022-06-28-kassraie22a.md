title: Meta-Learning Hypothesis Spaces for Sequential Decision-making
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Obtaining reliable, adaptive confidence sets for prediction functions (hypotheses)
  is a central challenge in sequential decision-making tasks, such as bandits and
  model-based reinforcement learning. These confidence sets typically rely on prior
  assumptions on the hypothesis space, e.g., the known kernel of a Reproducing Kernel
  Hilbert Space (RKHS). Hand-designing such kernels is error prone, and misspecification
  may lead to poor or unsafe performance. In this work, we propose to meta-learn a
  kernel from offline data (Meta-KeL). For the case where the unknown kernel is a
  combination of known base kernels, we develop an estimator based on structured sparsity.
  Under mild conditions, we guarantee that our estimated RKHS yields valid confidence
  sets that, with increasing amounts of offline data, become as tight as those given
  the true unknown kernel. We demonstrate our approach on the kernelized bandits problem
  (a.k.a. Bayesian optimization), where we establish regret bounds competitive with
  those given the true kernel. We also empirically evaluate the effectiveness of our
  approach on a Bayesian optimization task.
