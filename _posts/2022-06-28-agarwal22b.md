abstract: Decision trees and random forests (RF) are a cornerstone of modern machine
  learning practice. Due to their tendency to overfit, trees are typically regularized
  by a variety of techniques that modify their structure (e.g. pruning). We introduce
  Hierarchical Shrinkage (HS), a post-hoc algorithm which regularizes the tree not
  by altering its structure, but by shrinking the prediction over each leaf toward
  the sample means over each of its ancestors, with weights depending on a single
  regularization parameter and the number of samples in each ancestor. Since HS is
  a post-hoc method, it is extremely fast, compatible with any tree-growing algorithm
  and can be used synergistically with other regularization techniques. Extensive
  experiments over a wide variety of real-world datasets show that HS substantially
  increases the predictive performance of decision trees even when used in conjunction
  with other regularization techniques. Moreover, we find that applying HS to individual
  trees in a RF often improves its accuracy and interpretability by simplifying and
  stabilizing decision boundaries and SHAP values. We further explain HS by showing
  that it to be equivalent to ridge regression on a basis that is constructed of decision
  stumps associated to the internal nodes of a tree. All code and models are released
  in a full-fledged package available on Github
