title: Fair Representation Learning through Implicit Path Alignment
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We consider a fair representation learning perspective, where optimal predictors,
  on top of the data representation, are ensured to be invariant with respect to different
  sub-groups. Specifically, we formulate this intuition as a bi-level optimization,
  where the representation is learned in the outer-loop, and invariant optimal group
  predictors are updated in the inner-loop. Moreover, the proposed bi-level objective
  is demonstrated to fulfill the sufficiency rule, which is desirable in various practical
  scenarios but was not commonly studied in the fair learning. Besides, to avoid the
  high computational and memory cost of differentiating in the inner-loop of bi-level
  objective, we propose an implicit path alignment algorithm, which only relies on
  the solution of inner optimization and the implicit differentiation rather than
  the exact optimization path. We further analyze the error gap of the implicit approach
  and empirically validate the proposed method in both classification and regression
  settings. Experimental results show the consistently better trade-off in prediction
  performance and fairness measurement.
