title: 'Saute RL: Almost Surely Safe Reinforcement Learning Using State Augmentation'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Satisfying safety constraints almost surely (or with probability one) can
  be critical for the deployment of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in real-life applications.
  For example, plane landing and take-off should ideally occur with probability one.
  We address the problem by introducing Safety Augmented (Saute) Markov Decision Processes
  (MDPs), where the safety constraints are eliminated by augmenting them into the
  state-space and reshaping the objective. We show that Saute MDP satisfies the Bellman
  equation and moves us closer to solving Safe RL with constraints satisfied almost
  surely. We argue that Saute MDP allows viewing the Safe RL problem from a different
  perspective enabling new features. For instance, our approach has a plug-and-play
  nature, i.e., any RL algorithm can be "Sauteed‚Äù. Additionally, state augmentation
  allows for policy generalization across safety constraints. We finally show that
  Saute RL algorithms can outperform their state-of-the-art counterparts when constraint
  satisfaction is of high importance.
