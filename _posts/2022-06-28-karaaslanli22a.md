title: Simultaneous Graph Signal Clustering and Graph Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Graph learning (GL) aims to infer the topology of an unknown graph from
  a set of observations on its nodes, i.e., graph signals. While most of the existing
  GL approaches focus on homogeneous datasets, in many real world applications, data
  is heterogeneous, where graph signals are clustered and each cluster is associated
  with a different graph. In this paper, we address the problem of learning multiple
  graphs from heterogeneous data by formulating an optimization problem for joint
  graph signal clustering and graph topology inference. In particular, our approach
  extends spectral clustering by partitioning the graph signals not only based on
  their pairwise similarities but also their smoothness with respect to the graphs
  associated with the clusters. The proposed method also learns the representative
  graph for each cluster using the smoothness of the graph signals with respect to
  the graph topology. The resulting optimization problem is solved with an efficient
  block-coordinate descent algorithm and results on simulated and real data indicate
  the effectiveness of the proposed method.
