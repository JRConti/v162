title: Extended Unconstrained Features Model for Exploring Deep Neural Collapse
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The modern strategy for training deep neural networks for classification
  tasks includes optimizing the network’s weights even after the training error vanishes
  to further push the training loss toward zero. Recently, a phenomenon termed “neural
  collapse" (NC) has been empirically observed in this training procedure. Specifically,
  it has been shown that the learned features (the output of the penultimate layer)
  of within-class samples converge to their mean, and the means of different classes
  exhibit a certain tight frame structure, which is also aligned with the last layer’s
  weights. Recent papers have shown that minimizers with this structure emerge when
  optimizing a simplified “unconstrained features model" (UFM) with a regularized
  cross-entropy loss. In this paper, we further analyze and extend the UFM. First,
  we study the UFM for the regularized MSE loss, and show that the minimizers’ features
  can have a more delicate structure than in the cross-entropy case. This affects
  also the structure of the weights. Then, we extend the UFM by adding another layer
  of weights as well as ReLU nonlinearity to the model and generalize our previous
  results. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the usefulness of our nonlinear extended
  UFM in modeling the NC phenomenon that occurs with practical networks.
