title: Parsimonious Learning-Augmented Caching
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Learning-augmented algorithms—in which, traditional algorithms are augmented
  with machine-learned predictions—have emerged as a framework to go beyond worst-case
  analysis. The overarching goal is to design algorithms that perform near-optimally
  when the predictions are accurate yet retain certain worst-case guarantees irrespective
  of the accuracy of the predictions. This framework has been successfully applied
  to online problems such as caching where the predictions can be used to alleviate
  uncertainties. In this paper we introduce and study the setting in which the learning-augmented
  algorithm can utilize the predictions parsimoniously. We consider the caching problem—which
  has been extensively studied in the learning-augmented setting—and show that one
  can achieve quantitatively similar results but only using a <em>sublinear</em> number
  of predictions.
