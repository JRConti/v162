title: Exploring the Gap between Collapsed & Whitened Features in Self-Supervised
  Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Avoiding feature collapse, when a Neural Network (NN) encoder maps all inputs
  to a constant vector, is a shared implicit desideratum of various methodological
  advances in self-supervised learning (SSL). To that end, whitened features have
  been proposed as an explicit objective to ensure uncollapsed features \cite{zbontar2021barlow,ermolov2021whitening,hua2021feature,bardes2022vicreg}.
  We identify power law behaviour in eigenvalue decay, parameterised by exponent $\beta{\geq}0$,
  as a spectrum that bridges between the collapsed & whitened feature extremes. We
  provide theoretical & empirical evidence highlighting the factors in SSL, like projection
  layers & regularisation strength, that influence eigenvalue decay rate, & demonstrate
  that the degree of feature whitening affects generalisation, particularly in label
  scarce regimes. We use our insights to motivate a novel method, PMP (PostMan-Pat),
  which efficiently post-processes a pretrained encoder to enforce eigenvalue decay
  rate with power law exponent $\beta$, & find that PostMan-Pat delivers improved
  label efficiency and transferability across a range of SSL methods and encoder architectures.
