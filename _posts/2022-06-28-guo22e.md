title: Class-Imbalanced Semi-Supervised Learning with Adaptive Thresholding
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has proven to be successful in overcoming
  labeling difficulties by leveraging unlabeled data. Previous SSL algorithms typically
  assume a balanced class distribution. However, real-world datasets are usually class-imbalanced,
  causing the performance of existing SSL algorithms to be seriously decreased. One
  essential reason is that pseudo-labels for unlabeled data are selected based on
  a fixed confidence threshold, resulting in low performance on minority classes.
  In this paper, we develop a simple yet effective framework, which only involves
  adaptive thresholding for different classes in SSL algorithms, and achieves remarkable
  performance improvement on more than twenty imbalance ratios. Specifically, we explicitly
  optimize the number of pseudo-labels for each class in the SSL objective, so as
  to simultaneously obtain adaptive thresholds and minimize empirical risk. Moreover,
  the determination of the adaptive threshold can be efficiently obtained by a closed-form
  solution. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
  algorithms.
