abstract: Model stealing attacks present a dilemma for public machine learning APIs.
  To protect financial investments, companies may be forced to withhold important
  information about their models that could facilitate theft, including uncertainty
  estimates and prediction explanations. This compromise is harmful not only to users
  but also to external transparency. Model stealing defenses seek to resolve this
  dilemma by making models harder to steal while preserving utility for benign users.
  However, existing defenses have poor performance in practice, either requiring enormous
  computational overheads or severe utility trade-offs. To meet these challenges,
  we present a new approach to model stealing defenses called gradient redirection.
  At the core of our approach is a provably optimal, efficient algorithm for steering
  an adversaryâ€™s training updates in a targeted manner. Combined with improvements
  to surrogate networks and a novel coordinated defense strategy, our gradient redirection
  defense, called GRAD^2, achieves small utility trade-offs and low computational
  overhead, outperforming the best prior defenses. Moreover, we demonstrate how gradient
  redirection enables reprogramming the adversary with arbitrary behavior, which we
  hope will foster work on new avenues of defense.
