title: Differentially Private Community Detection for Stochastic Block Models
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'The goal of community detection over graphs is to recover underlying labels/attributes
  of users (e.g., political affiliation) given the connectivity between users. There
  has been significant recent progress on understanding the fundamental limits of
  community detection when the graph is generated from a stochastic block model (SBM).
  Specifically, sharp information theoretic limits and efficient algorithms have been
  obtained for SBMs as a function of $p$ and $q$, which represent the intra-community
  and inter-community connection probabilities. In this paper, we study the community
  detection problem while preserving the privacy of the individual connections between
  the vertices. Focusing on the notion of $(\epsilon, \delta)$-edge differential privacy
  (DP), we seek to understand the fundamental tradeoffs between $(p, q)$, DP budget
  $(\epsilon, \delta)$, and computational efficiency for exact recovery of community
  labels. To this end, we present and analyze the associated information-theoretic
  tradeoffs for three differentially private community recovery mechanisms: a) stability
  based mechanism; b) sampling based mechanisms; and c) graph perturbation mechanisms.
  Our main findings are that stability and sampling based mechanisms lead to a superior
  tradeoff between $(p,q)$ and the privacy budget $(\epsilon, \delta)$; however this
  comes at the expense of higher computational complexity. On the other hand, albeit
  low complexity, graph perturbation mechanisms require the privacy budget $\epsilon$
  to scale as $\Omega(\log(n))$ for exact recovery.'
