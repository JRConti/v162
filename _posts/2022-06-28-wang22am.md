title: How Powerful are Spectral Graph Neural Networks
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Spectral Graph Neural Network is a kind of Graph Neural Network (GNN) based
  on graph signal filters. Some models able to learn arbitrary spectral filters have
  emerged recently. However, few works analyze the expressive power of spectral GNNs.
  This paper studies spectral GNNs’ expressive power theoretically. We first prove
  that even spectral GNNs without nonlinearity can produce arbitrary graph signals
  and give two conditions for reaching universality. They are: 1) no multiple eigenvalues
  of graph Laplacian, and 2) no missing frequency components in node features. We
  also establish a connection between the expressive power of spectral GNNs and Graph
  Isomorphism (GI) testing, the latter of which is often used to characterize spatial
  GNNs’ expressive power. Moreover, we study the difference in empirical performance
  among different spectral GNNs with the same expressive power from an optimization
  perspective, and motivate the use of an orthogonal basis whose weight function corresponds
  to the graph signal density in the spectrum. Inspired by the analysis, we propose
  JacobiConv, which uses Jacobi basis due to its orthogonality and flexibility to
  adapt to a wide range of weight functions. JacobiConv deserts nonlinearity while
  outperforming all baselines on both synthetic and real-world datasets.'
