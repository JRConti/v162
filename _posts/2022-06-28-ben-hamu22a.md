title: Matching Normalizing Flows and Probability Paths on Manifolds
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNFs) are a class of generative models that
  transform a prior distribution to a model distribution by solving an ordinary differential
  equation (ODE). We propose to train CNFs on manifolds by minimizing probability
  path divergence (PPD), a novel family of divergences between the probability density
  path generated by the CNF and a target probability density path. PPD is formulated
  using a logarithmic mass conservation formula which is a linear first order partial
  differential equation relating the log target probabilities and the CNFâ€™s defining
  vector field. PPD has several key benefits over existing methods: it sidesteps the
  need to solve an ODE per iteration, readily applies to manifold data, scales to
  high dimensions, and is compatible with a large family of target paths interpolating
  pure noise and data in finite time. Theoretically, PPD is shown to bound classical
  probability divergences. Empirically, we show that CNFs learned by minimizing PPD
  achieve state-of-the-art results in likelihoods and sample quality on existing low-dimensional
  manifold benchmarks, and is the first example of a generative model to scale to
  moderately high dimensional manifolds.'
