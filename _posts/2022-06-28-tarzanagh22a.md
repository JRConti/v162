title: 'FedNest: Federated Bilevel, Minimax, and Compositional Optimization'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Standard federated optimization methods successfully apply to stochastic
  problems with single-level structure. However, many contemporary ML problems - including
  adversarial robustness, hyperparameter tuning, actor-critic - fall under nested
  bilevel programming that subsumes minimax and compositional optimization. In this
  work, we propose FedNest: A federated alternating stochastic gradient method to
  address general nested problems. We establish provable convergence rates for FedNest
  in the presence of heterogeneous data and introduce variations for bilevel, minimax,
  and compositional optimization. FedNest introduces multiple innovations including
  federated hypergradient computation and variance reduction to address inner-level
  heterogeneity. We complement our theory with experiments on hyperparameter & hyper-representation
  learning and minimax optimization that demonstrate the benefits of our method in
  practice.'
