title: 'DreamerPro: Reconstruction-Free Model-Based Reinforcement Learning with Prototypical
  Representations'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Reconstruction-based Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) agents, such
  as Dreamer, often fail to discard task-irrelevant visual distractions that are prevalent
  in natural scenes. In this paper, we propose a reconstruction-free MBRL agent, called
  DreamerPro, that can enhance robustness to distractions. Motivated by the recent
  success of prototypical representations, a non-contrastive self-supervised learning
  approach in computer vision, DreamerPro combines Dreamer with prototypes. In order
  for the prototypes to benefit temporal dynamics learning in MBRL, we propose to
  additionally learn the prototypes from the recurrent states of the world model,
  thereby distilling temporal structures from past observations and actions into the
  prototypes. Experiments on the DeepMind Control suite show that DreamerPro achieves
  better overall performance than state-of-the-art contrastive MBRL agents when there
  are complex background distractions, and maintains similar performance as Dreamer
  in standard tasks where contrastive MBRL agents can perform much worse.
