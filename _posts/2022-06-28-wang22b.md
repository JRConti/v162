title: Accelerating Shapley Explanation via Contributive Cooperator Selection
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Even though Shapley value provides an effective explanation for a DNN model
  prediction, the computation relies on the enumeration of all possible input feature
  coalitions, which leads to the exponentially growing complexity. To address this
  problem, we propose a novel method SHEAR to significantly accelerate the Shapley
  explanation for DNN models, where only a few coalitions of input features are involved
  in the computation. The selection of the feature coalitions follows our proposed
  Shapley chain rule to minimize the absolute error from the ground-truth Shapley
  values, such that the computation can be both efficient and accurate. To demonstrate
  the effectiveness, we comprehensively evaluate SHEAR across multiple metrics including
  the absolute error from the ground-truth Shapley value, the faithfulness of the
  explanations, and running speed. The experimental results indicate SHEAR consistently
  outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods across different evaluation metrics,
  which demonstrates its potentials in real-world applications where the computational
  resource is limited.
