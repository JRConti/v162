title: A Multi-objective / Multi-task Learning Framework Induced by Pareto Stationarity
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Multi-objective optimization (MOO) and multi-task learning (MTL) have gained
  much popularity with prevalent use cases such as production model development of
  regression / classification / ranking models with MOO, and training deep learning
  models with MTL. Despite the long history of research in MOO, its application to
  machine learning requires development of solution strategy, and algorithms have
  recently been developed to solve specific problems such as discovery of any Pareto
  optimal (PO) solution, and that with a particular form of preference. In this paper,
  we develop a novel and generic framework to discover a PO solution with multiple
  forms of preferences. It allows us to formulate a generic MOO / MTL problem to express
  a preference, which is solved to achieve both alignment with the preference and
  PO, at the same time. Specifically, we apply the framework to solve the weighted
  Chebyshev problem and an extension of that. The former is known as a method to discover
  the Pareto front, the latter helps to find a model that outperforms an existing
  model with only one run. Experimental results demonstrate not only the method achieves
  competitive performance with existing methods, but also it allows us to achieve
  the performance from different forms of preferences.
