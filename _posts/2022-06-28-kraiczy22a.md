title: 'Exact Learning of Preference Structure: Single-peaked Preferences and Beyond'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'We consider the setting where the members of a society (voters) have preferences
  over candidates, and the candidates can be ordered on an axis so that the voters’
  preferences are single-peaked on this axis. We ask whether this axis can be identified
  by sampling the voters’ preferences. For several natural distributions, we obtain
  tight bounds on the number of samples required and show that, surprisingly, the
  bounds are independent of the number of candidates. We extend our results to the
  case where voters’ preferences are sampled from two different axes over the same
  candidate set (one of which may be known). We also consider two alternative models
  of learning: (1) sampling pairwise comparisons rather than entire votes, and (2)
  learning from equivalence queries.'
