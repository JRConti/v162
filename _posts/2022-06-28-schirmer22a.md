title: Modeling Irregular Time Series with Continuous Recurrent Units
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a popular choice for modeling sequential
  data. Modern RNN architectures assume constant time-intervals between observations.
  However, in many datasets (e.g. medical records) observation times are irregular
  and can carry important information. To address this challenge, we propose continuous
  recurrent units (CRUs) {â€“} a neural architecture that can naturally handle irregular
  intervals between observations. The CRU assumes a hidden state, which evolves according
  to a linear stochastic differential equation and is integrated into an encoder-decoder
  framework. The recursive computations of the CRU can be derived using the continuous-discrete
  Kalman filter and are in closed form. The resulting recurrent architecture has temporal
  continuity between hidden states and a gating mechanism that can optimally integrate
  noisy observations. We derive an efficient parameterization scheme for the CRU that
  leads to a fast implementation f-CRU. We empirically study the CRU on a number of
  challenging datasets and find that it can interpolate irregular time series better
  than methods based on neural ordinary differential equations.
