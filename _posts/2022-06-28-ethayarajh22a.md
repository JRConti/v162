title: Understanding Dataset Difficulty with $\mathcal{V}$-Usable Information
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Estimating the difficulty of a dataset typically involves comparing state-of-the-art
  models to humans; the bigger the performance gap, the harder the dataset is said
  to be. However, this comparison provides little understanding of how difficult each
  instance in a given distribution is, or what attributes make the dataset difficult
  for a given model. To address these questions, we frame dataset difficulty—w.r.t.
  a model $\mathcal{V}$—as the lack of $\mathcal{V}$-usable information (Xu et al.,
  2019), where a lower value indicates a more difficult dataset for $\mathcal{V}$.
  We further introduce pointwise $\mathcal{V}$-information (PVI) for measuring the
  difficulty of individual instances w.r.t. a given distribution. While standard evaluation
  metrics typically only compare different models for the same dataset, $\mathcal{V}$-usable
  information and PVI also permit the converse: for a given model $\mathcal{V}$, we
  can compare different datasets, as well as different instances/slices of the same
  dataset. Furthermore, our framework allows for the interpretability of different
  input attributes via transformations of the input, which we use to discover annotation
  artefacts in widely-used NLP benchmarks.'
