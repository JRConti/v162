title: 'LCANets: Lateral Competition Improves Robustness Against Corruption and Attack'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Although Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) achieve high accuracy on image
  recognition tasks, they lack robustness against realistic corruptions and fail catastrophically
  when deliberately attacked. Previous CNNs with representations similar to primary
  visual cortex (V1) were more robust to adversarial attacks on images than current
  adversarial defense techniques, but they required training on large-scale neural
  recordings or handcrafting neuroscientific models. Motivated by evidence that neural
  activity in V1 is sparse, we develop a class of hybrid CNNs, called LCANets, which
  feature a frontend that performs sparse coding via local lateral competition. We
  demonstrate that LCANets achieve competitive clean accuracy to standard CNNs on
  action and image recognition tasks and significantly greater accuracy under various
  image corruptions. We also perform the first adversarial attacks with full knowledge
  of a sparse coding CNN layer by attacking LCANets with white-box and black-box attacks,
  and we show that, contrary to previous hypotheses, sparse coding layers are not
  very robust to white-box attacks. Finally, we propose a way to use sparse coding
  layers as a plug-and-play robust frontend by showing that they significantly increase
  the robustness of adversarially-trained CNNs over corruptions and attacks.
