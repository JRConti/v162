title: 'Probabilistically Robust Learning: Balancing Average and Worst-case Performance'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Many of the successes of machine learning are based on minimizing an averaged
  loss function. However, it is well-known that this paradigm suffers from robustness
  issues that hinder its applicability in safety-critical domains. These issues are
  often addressed by training against worst-case perturbations of data, a technique
  known as adversarial training. Although empirically effective, adversarial training
  can be overly conservative, leading to unfavorable trade-offs between nominal performance
  and robustness. To this end, in this paper we propose a framework called probabilistic
  robustness that bridges the gap between the accurate, yet brittle average case and
  the robust, yet conservative worst case by enforcing robustness to most rather than
  to all perturbations. From a theoretical point of view, this framework overcomes
  the trade-offs between the performance and the sample-complexity of worst-case and
  average-case learning. From a practical point of view, we propose a novel algorithm
  based on risk-aware optimization that effectively balances average- and worst-case
  performance at a considerably lower computational cost relative to adversarial training.
  Our results on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN illustrate the advantages of this framework
  on the spectrum from average- to worst-case robustness. Our code is available at:
