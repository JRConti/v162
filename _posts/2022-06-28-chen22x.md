title: Deep Variational Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network for Multivariate Time
  Series Anomaly Detection
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Anomaly detection within multivariate time series (MTS) is an essential
  task in both data mining and service quality management. Many recent works on anomaly
  detection focus on designing unsupervised probabilistic models to extract robust
  normal patterns of MTS. In this paper, we model sensor dependency and stochasticity
  within MTS by developing an embedding-guided probabilistic generative network. We
  combine it with adaptive variational graph convolutional recurrent network %and
  get variational GCRN (VGCRN) to model both spatial and temporal fine-grained correlations
  in MTS. To explore hierarchical latent representations, we further extend VGCRN
  into a deep variational network, which captures multilevel information at different
  layers and is robust to noisy time series. Moreover, we develop an upward-downward
  variational inference scheme that considers both forecasting-based and reconstruction-based
  losses, achieving an accurate posterior approximation of latent variables with better
  MTS representations. The experiments verify the superiority of the proposed method
  over current state-of-the-art methods.
