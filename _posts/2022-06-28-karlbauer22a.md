title: Composing Partial Differential Equations with Physics-Aware Neural Networks
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We introduce a compositional physics-aware FInite volume Neural Network
  (FINN) for learning spatiotemporal advection-diffusion processes. FINN implements
  a new way of combining the learning abilities of artificial neural networks with
  physical and structural knowledge from numerical simulation by modeling the constituents
  of partial differential equations (PDEs) in a compositional manner. Results on both
  one- and two-dimensional PDEs (Burgers’, diffusion-sorption, diffusion-reaction,
  Allen{–}Cahn) demonstrate FINN’s superior modeling accuracy and excellent out-of-distribution
  generalization ability beyond initial and boundary conditions. With only one tenth
  of the number of parameters on average, FINN outperforms pure machine learning and
  other state-of-the-art physics-aware models in all cases{—}often even by multiple
  orders of magnitude. Moreover, FINN outperforms a calibrated physical model when
  approximating sparse real-world data in a diffusion-sorption scenario, confirming
  its generalization abilities and showing explanatory potential by revealing the
  unknown retardation factor of the observed process.
