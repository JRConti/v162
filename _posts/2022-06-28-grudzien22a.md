title: 'Mirror Learning: A Unifying Framework of Policy Optimisation'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Modern deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are motivated by either
  the general policy improvement (GPI) or trust-region learning (TRL) frameworks.
  However, algorithms that strictly respect these theoretical frameworks have proven
  unscalable. Surprisingly, the only known scalable algorithms violate the GPI/TRL
  assumptions, e.g. due to required regularisation or other heuristics. The current
  explanation of their empirical success is essentially “by analogy”: they are deemed
  approximate adaptations of theoretically sound methods. Unfortunately, studies have
  shown that in practice these algorithms differ greatly from their conceptual ancestors.
  In contrast, in this paper, we introduce a novel theoretical framework, named Mirror
  Learning, which provides theoretical guarantees to a large class of algorithms,
  including TRPO and PPO. While the latter two exploit the flexibility of our framework,
  GPI and TRL fit in merely as pathologically restrictive corner cases thereof. This
  suggests that the empirical performance of state-of-the-art methods is a direct
  consequence of their theoretical properties, rather than of aforementioned approximate
  analogies. Mirror learning sets us free to boldly explore novel, theoretically sound
  RL algorithms, a thus far uncharted wonderland.'
