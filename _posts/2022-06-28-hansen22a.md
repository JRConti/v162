title: Temporal Difference Learning for Model Predictive Control
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Data-driven model predictive control has two key advantages over model-free
  methods: a potential for improved sample efficiency through model learning, and
  better performance as computational budget for planning increases. However, it is
  both costly to plan over long horizons and challenging to obtain an accurate model
  of the environment. In this work, we combine the strengths of model-free and model-based
  methods. We use a learned task-oriented latent dynamics model for local trajectory
  optimization over a short horizon, and use a learned terminal value function to
  estimate long-term return, both of which are learned jointly by temporal difference
  learning. Our method, TD-MPC, achieves superior sample efficiency and asymptotic
  performance over prior work on both state and image-based continuous control tasks
  from DMControl and Meta-World. Code and videos are available at https://nicklashansen.github.io/td-mpc.'
