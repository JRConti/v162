title: The Infinite Contextual Graph Markov Model
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'The Contextual Graph Markov Model (CGMM) is a deep, unsupervised, and probabilistic
  model for graphs that is trained incrementally on a layer-by-layer basis. As with
  most Deep Graph Networks, an inherent limitation is the need to perform an extensive
  model selection to choose the proper size of each layer’s latent representation.
  In this paper, we address this problem by introducing the Infinite Contextual Graph
  Markov Model (iCGMM), the first deep Bayesian nonparametric model for graph learning.
  During training, iCGMM can adapt the complexity of each layer to better fit the
  underlying data distribution. On 8 graph classification tasks, we show that iCGMM:
  i) successfully recovers or improves CGMM’s performances while reducing the hyper-parameters’
  search space; ii) performs comparably to most end-to-end supervised methods. The
  results include studies on the importance of depth, hyper-parameters, and compression
  of the graph embeddings. We also introduce a novel approximated inference procedure
  that better deals with larger graph topologies.'
