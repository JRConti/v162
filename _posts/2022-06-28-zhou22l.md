title: Contrastive Learning with Boosted Memorization
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Self-supervised learning has achieved a great success in the representation
  learning of visual and textual data. However, the current methods are mainly validated
  on the well-curated datasets, which do not exhibit the real-world long-tailed distribution.
  Recent attempts to consider self-supervised long-tailed learning are made by rebalancing
  in the loss perspective or the model perspective, resembling the paradigms in the
  supervised long-tailed learning. Nevertheless, without the aid of labels, these
  explorations have not shown the expected significant promise due to the limitation
  in tail sample discovery or the heuristic structure design. Different from previous
  works, we explore this direction from an alternative perspective, i.e., the data
  perspective, and propose a novel Boosted Contrastive Learning (BCL) method. Specifically,
  BCL leverages the memorization effect of deep neural networks to automatically drive
  the information discrepancy of the sample views in contrastive learning, which is
  more efficient to enhance the long-tailed learning in the label-unaware context.
  Extensive experiments on a range of benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
  of BCL over several state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/MediaBrain-SJTU/BCL.
