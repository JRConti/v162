title: State Transition of Dendritic Spines Improves Learning of Sparse Spiking Neural
  Networks
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are considered a promising alternative to
  Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for their event-driven computing paradigm when
  deployed on energy-efficient neuromorphic hardware. Recently, deep SNNs have shown
  breathtaking performance improvement through cutting-edge training strategy and
  flexible structure, which also scales up the number of parameters and computational
  burdens in a single network. Inspired by the state transition of dendritic spines
  in the filopodial model of spinogenesis, we model different states of SNN weights,
  facilitating weight optimization for pruning. Furthermore, the pruning speed can
  be regulated by using different functions describing the growing threshold of state
  transition. We organize these techniques as a dynamic pruning algorithm based on
  nonlinear reparameterization mapping from spine size to SNN weights. Our approach
  yields sparse deep networks on the large-scale dataset (SEW ResNet18 on ImageNet)
  while maintaining state-of-the-art low performance loss (Â 3% at 88.8% sparsity)
  compared to existing pruning methods on directly trained SNNs. Moreover, we find
  out pruning speed regulation while learning is crucial to avoiding disastrous performance
  degradation at the final stages of training, which may shed light on future work
  on SNN pruning.
