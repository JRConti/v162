  Correlations'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Spurious correlations pose a major challenge for robust machine learning.
  Models trained with empirical risk minimization (ERM) may learn to rely on correlations
  between class labels and spurious attributes, leading to poor performance on data
  groups without these correlations. This is challenging to address when the spurious
  attribute labels are unavailable. To improve worst-group performance on spuriously
  correlated data without training attribute labels, we propose Correct-N-Contrast
  (CNC), a contrastive approach to directly learn representations robust to spurious
  correlations. As ERM models can be good spurious attribute predictors, CNC works
  by (1) using a trained ERM model’s outputs to identify samples with the same class
  but dissimilar spurious features, and (2) training a robust model with contrastive
  learning to learn similar representations for these samples. To support CNC, we
  introduce new connections between worst-group error and a representation alignment
  loss that CNC aims to minimize. We empirically observe that worst-group error closely
  tracks with alignment loss, and prove that the alignment loss over a class helps
  upper-bound the class’s worst-group vs. average error gap. On popular benchmarks,
  CNC reduces alignment loss drastically, and achieves state-of-the-art worst-group
  accuracy by 3.6% average absolute lift. CNC is also competitive with oracle methods
  that require group labels.
