title: Optimization-Derived Learning with Essential Convergence Analysis of Training
  and Hyper-training
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Recently, Optimization-Derived Learning (ODL) has attracted attention from
  learning and vision areas, which designs learning models from the perspective of
  optimization. However, previous ODL approaches regard the training and hyper-training
  procedures as two separated stages, meaning that the hyper-training variables have
  to be fixed during the training process, and thus it is also impossible to simultaneously
  obtain the convergence of training and hyper-training variables. In this work, we
  design a Generalized Krasnoselskii-Mann (GKM) scheme based on fixed-point iterations
  as our fundamental ODL module, which unifies existing ODL methods as special cases.
  Under the GKM scheme, a Bilevel Meta Optimization (BMO) algorithmic framework is
  constructed to solve the optimal training and hyper-training variables together.
  We rigorously prove the essential joint convergence of the fixed-point iteration
  for training and the process of optimizing hyper-parameters for hyper-training,
  both on the approximation quality, and on the stationary analysis. Experiments demonstrate
  the efficiency of BMO with competitive performance on sparse coding and real-world
  applications such as image deconvolution and rain streak removal.
