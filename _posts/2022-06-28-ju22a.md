  Guarantees
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We consider transfer learning approaches that fine-tune a pretrained deep
  neural network on a target task. We investigate generalization properties of fine-tuning
  to understand the problem of overfitting, which often happens in practice. Previous
  works have shown that constraining the distance from the initialization of fine-tuning
  improves generalization. Using a PAC-Bayesian analysis, we observe that besides
  distance from initialization, Hessians affect generalization through the noise stability
  of deep neural networks against noise injections. Motivated by the observation,
  we develop Hessian distance-based generalization bounds for a wide range of fine-tuning
  methods. Next, we investigate the robustness of fine-tuning with noisy labels. We
  design an algorithm that incorporates consistent losses and distance-based regularization
  for fine-tuning. Additionally, we prove a generalization error bound of our algorithm
  under class conditional independent noise in the training dataset labels. We perform
  a detailed empirical study of our algorithm on various noisy environments and architectures.
  For example, on six image classification tasks whose training labels are generated
  with programmatic labeling, we show a 3.26% accuracy improvement over prior methods.
  Meanwhile, the Hessian distance measure of the fine-tuned network using our algorithm
  decreases by six times more than existing approaches.
