title: Fast Relative Entropy Coding with A* coding
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Relative entropy coding (REC) algorithms encode a sample from a target distribution
  Q using a proposal distribution P, such that the expected codelength is O(KL[Q ||
  P]). REC can be seamlessly integrated with existing learned compression models since,
  unlike entropy coding, it does not assume discrete Q or P, and does not require
  quantisation. However, general REC algorithms require an intractable $\Omega$(exp(KL[Q
  || P])) runtime. We introduce AS* and AD* coding, two REC algorithms based on A*
  sampling. We prove that, for continuous distributions over the reals, if the density
  ratio is unimodal, AS* has O(D$\infty$[Q || P]) expected runtime, where D$\infty$[Q
  || P] is the Renyi $\infty$-divergence. We provide experimental evidence that AD*
  also has O(D$\infty$[Q || P]) expected runtime. We prove that AS* and AD* achieve
  an expected codelength of O(KL[Q || P]). Further, we introduce DAD*, an approximate
  algorithm based on AD* which retains its favourable runtime and has bias similar
  to that of alternative methods. Focusing on VAEs, we propose the IsoKL VAE (IKVAE),
  which can be used with DAD* to further improve compression efficiency. We evaluate
  A* coding with (IK)VAEs on MNIST, showing that it can losslessly compress images
  near the theoretically optimal limit.
