title: Cross-Space Active Learning on Graph Convolutional Networks
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: This paper formalizes <em>cross-space</em> active learning on a graph convolutional
  network (GCN). The objective is to attain the most accurate hypothesis available
  in any of the instance spaces generated by the GCN. Subject to the objective, the
  challenge is to minimize the <em>label cost</em>, measured in the number of vertices
  whose labels are requested. Our study covers both <em>budget algorithms</em> which
  terminate after a designated number of label requests, and <em>verifiable algorithms</em>
  which terminate only after having found an accurate hypothesis. A new separation
  in label complexity between the two algorithm types is established. The separation
  is unique to GCNs.
