title: Causal Inference Through the Structural Causal Marginal Problem
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'We introduce an approach to counterfactual inference based on merging information
  from multiple datasets. We consider a causal reformulation of the statistical marginal
  problem: given a collection of marginal structural causal models (SCMs) over distinct
  but overlapping sets of variables, determine the set of joint SCMs that are counterfactually
  consistent with the marginal ones. We formalise this approach for categorical SCMs
  using the response function formulation and show that it reduces the space of allowed
  marginal and joint SCMs. Our work thus highlights a new mode of falsifiability through
  additional variables, in contrast to the statistical one via additional data.'
