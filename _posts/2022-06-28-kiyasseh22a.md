title: 'SoQal: Selective Oracle Questioning for Consistency Based Active Learning
  of Cardiac Signals'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Clinical settings are often characterized by abundant unlabelled data and
  limited labelled data. This is typically driven by the high burden placed on oracles
  (e.g., physicians) to provide annotations. One way to mitigate this burden is via
  active learning (AL) which involves the (a) acquisition and (b) annotation of informative
  unlabelled instances. Whereas previous work addresses either one of these elements
  independently, we propose an AL framework that addresses both. For acquisition,
  we propose Bayesian Active Learning by Consistency (BALC), a sub-framework which
  perturbs both instances and network parameters and quantifies changes in the network
  output probability distribution. For annotation, we propose SoQal, a sub-framework
  that dynamically determines whether, for each acquired unlabelled instance, to request
  a label from an oracle or to pseudo-label it instead. We show that BALC can outperform
  start-of-the-art acquisition functions such as BALD, and SoQal outperforms baseline
  methods even in the presence of a noisy oracle.
