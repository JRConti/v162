title: On Measuring Causal Contributions via do-interventions
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Causal contributions measure the strengths of different causes to a target
  quantity. Understanding causal contributions is important in empirical sciences
  and data-driven disciplines since it allows to answer practical queries like “what
  are the contributions of each cause to the effect?” In this paper, we develop a
  principled method for quantifying causal contributions. First, we provide desiderata
  of properties axioms that causal contribution measures should satisfy and propose
  the do-Shapley values (inspired by do-interventions [Pearl, 2000]) as a unique method
  satisfying these properties. Next, we develop a criterion under which the do-Shapley
  values can be efficiently inferred from non-experimental data. Finally, we provide
  do-Shapley estimators exhibiting consistency, computational feasibility, and statistical
  robustness. Simulation results corroborate with the theory.
