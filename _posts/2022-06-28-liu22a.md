title: Distributionally Robust $Q$-Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable achievements in
  simulated environments. However, carrying this success to real environments requires
  the important attribute of robustness, which the existing RL algorithms often lack
  as they assume that the future deployment environment is the same as the training
  environment (i.e. simulator) in which the policy is learned. This assumption often
  does not hold due to the discrepancy between the simulator and the real environment
  and, as a result, and hence renders the learned policy fragile when deployed. In
  this paper, we propose a novel distributionally robust $Q$-learning algorithm that
  learns the best policy in the worst distributional perturbation of the environment.
  Our algorithm first transforms the infinite-dimensional learning problem (since
  the environment MDP perturbation lies in an infinite-dimensional space) into a finite-dimensional
  dual problem and subsequently uses a multi-level Monte-Carlo scheme to approximate
  the dual value using samples from the simulator. Despite the complexity, we show
  that the resulting distributionally robust $Q$-learning algorithm asymptotically
  converges to optimal worst-case policy, thus making it robust to future environment
  changes. Simulation results further demonstrate its strong empirical robustness.
