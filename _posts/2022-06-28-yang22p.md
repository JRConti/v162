title: Estimating Instance-dependent Bayes-label Transition Matrix using a Deep Neural
  Network
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In label-noise learning, estimating the transition matrix is a hot topic
  as the matrix plays an important role in building statistically consistent classifiers.
  Traditionally, the transition from clean labels to noisy labels (i.e., clean-label
  transition matrix (CLTM)) has been widely exploited to learn a clean label classifier
  by employing the noisy data. Motivated by that classifiers mostly output Bayes optimal
  labels for prediction, in this paper, we study to directly model the transition
  from Bayes optimal labels to noisy labels (i.e., Bayes-label transition matrix (BLTM))
  and learn a classifier to predict Bayes optimal labels. Note that given only noisy
  data, it is ill-posed to estimate either the CLTM or the BLTM. But favorably, Bayes
  optimal labels have less uncertainty compared with the clean labels, i.e., the class
  posteriors of Bayes optimal labels are one-hot vectors while those of clean labels
  are not. This enables two advantages to estimate the BLTM, i.e., (a) a set of examples
  with theoretically guaranteed Bayes optimal labels can be collected out of noisy
  data; (b) the feasible solution space is much smaller. By exploiting the advantages,
  we estimate the BLTM parametrically by employing a deep neural network, leading
  to better generalization and superior classification performance.
