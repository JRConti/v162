title: Generalized Results for the Existence and Consistency of the MLE in the Bradley-Terry-Luce
  Model
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Ranking problems based on pairwise comparisons, such as those arising in
  online gaming, often involve a large pool of items to order. In these situations,
  the gap in performance between any two items can be significant, and the smallest
  and largest winning probabilities can be very close to zero or one. Furthermore,
  each item may be compared only to a subset of all the items, so that not all pairwise
  comparisons are observed. In this paper, we study the performance of the Bradley-Terry-Luce
  model for ranking from pairwise comparison data under more realistic settings than
  those considered in the literature so far. In particular, we allow for near-degenerate
  winning probabilities and arbitrary comparison designs. We obtain novel results
  about the existence of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) and the corresponding
  $\ell_2$ estimation error without the bounded winning probability assumption commonly
  used in the literature and for arbitrary comparison graph topologies. Central to
  our approach is the reliance on the Fisher information matrix to express the dependence
  on the graph topologies and the impact of the values of the winning probabilities
  on the estimation risk and on the conditions for the existence of the MLE. Our bounds
  recover existing results as special cases but are more broadly applicable.
