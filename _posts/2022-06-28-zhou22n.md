  Pre-training'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Recent advances in vision-language pre-training (VLP) have demonstrated
  impressive performance in a range of vision-language (VL) tasks. However, there
  exist several challenges for measuring the community’s progress in building general
  multi-modal intelligence. First, most of the downstream VL datasets are annotated
  using raw images that are already seen during pre-training, which may result in
  an overestimation of current VLP models’ generalization ability. Second, recent
  VLP work mainly focuses on absolute performance but overlooks the efficiency-performance
  trade-off, which is also an important indicator for measuring progress. To this
  end, we introduce the Vision-Language Understanding Evaluation (VLUE) benchmark,
  a multi-task multi-dimension benchmark for evaluating the generalization capabilities
  and the efficiency-performance trade-off (“Pareto SOTA”) of VLP models. We demonstrate
  that there is a sizable generalization gap for all VLP models when testing on out-of-distribution
  test sets annotated on images from a more diverse distribution that spreads across
  cultures. Moreover, we find that measuring the efficiency-performance trade-off
  of VLP models leads to complementary insights for several design choices of VLP.
  We release the VLUE benchmark to promote research on building vision-language models
  that generalize well to images unseen during pre-training and are practical in terms
  of efficiency-performance trade-off.
