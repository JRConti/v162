title: Stochastic smoothing of the top-K calibrated hinge loss for deep imbalanced
  classification
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In modern classification tasks, the number of labels is getting larger and
  larger, as is the size of the datasets encountered in practice. As the number of
  classes increases, class ambiguity and class imbalance become more and more problematic
  to achieve high top-1 accuracy. Meanwhile, Top-K metrics (metrics allowing K guesses)
  have become popular, especially for performance reporting. Yet, proposing top-K
  losses tailored for deep learning remains a challenge, both theoretically and practically.
  In this paper we introduce a stochastic top-K hinge loss inspired by recent developments
  on top-K calibrated losses. Our proposal is based on the smoothing of the top-K
  operator building on the flexible "perturbed optimizer" framework. We show that
  our loss function performs very well in the case of balanced datasets, while benefiting
  from a significantly lower computational time than the state-of-the-art top-K loss
  function. In addition, we propose a simple variant of our loss for the imbalanced
  case. Experiments on a heavy-tailed dataset show that our loss function significantly
  outperforms other baseline loss functions.
