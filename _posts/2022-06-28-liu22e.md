title: Equivalence Analysis between Counterfactual Regret Minimization and Online
  Mirror Descent
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) and Online Mirror Descent (OMD) are
  regret minimization algorithms for Online Convex Optimization (OCO), they are mathematically
  elegant but less practical in solving Extensive-Form Games (EFGs). Counterfactual
  Regret Minimization (CFR) is a technique for approximating Nash equilibria in EFGs.
  CFR and its variants have a fast convergence rate in practice, but their theoretical
  results are not satisfactory. In recent years, researchers have been trying to link
  CFRs with OCO algorithms, which may provide new theoretical results and inspire
  new algorithms. However, existing analysis is restricted to local decision points.
  In this paper, we show that CFRs with Regret Matching and Regret Matching+ are equivalent
  to special cases of FTRL and OMD, respectively. According to these equivalences,
  a new FTRL and a new OMD algorithm, which can be considered as extensions of vanilla
  CFR and CFR+, are derived. The experimental results show that the two variants converge
  faster than conventional FTRL and OMD, even faster than vanilla CFR and CFR+ in
  some EFGs.
