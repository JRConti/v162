title: 'ROCK: Causal Inference Principles for Reasoning about Commonsense Causality'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Commonsense causality reasoning (CCR) aims at identifying plausible causes
  and effects in natural language descriptions that are deemed reasonable by an average
  person. Although being of great academic and practical interest, this problem is
  still shadowed by the lack of a well-posed theoretical framework; existing work
  usually relies on deep language models wholeheartedly, and is potentially susceptible
  to confounding co-occurrences. Motivated by classical causal principles, we articulate
  the central question of CCR and draw parallels between human subjects in observational
  studies and natural languages to adopt CCR to the potential-outcomes framework,
  which is the first such attempt for commonsense tasks. We propose a novel framework,
  ROCK, to Reason O(A)bout Commonsense K(C)ausality, which utilizes temporal signals
  as incidental supervision, and balances confounding effects using temporal propensities
  that are analogous to propensity scores. The ROCK implementation is modular and
  zero-shot, and demonstrates good CCR capabilities.
