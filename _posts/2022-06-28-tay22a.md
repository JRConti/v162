title: Efficient Distributionally Robust Bayesian Optimization with Worst-case Sensitivity
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In distributionally robust Bayesian optimization (DRBO), an exact computation
  of the worst-case expected value requires solving an expensive convex optimization
  problem. We develop a fast approximation of the worst-case expected value based
  on the notion of worst-case sensitivity that caters to arbitrary convex distribution
  distances. We provide a regret bound for our novel DRBO algorithm with the fast
  approximation, and empirically show it is competitive with that using the exact
  worst-case expected value while incurring significantly less computation time. In
  order to guide the choice of distribution distance to be used with DRBO, we show
  that our approximation implicitly optimizes an objective close to an interpretable
  risk-sensitive value.
