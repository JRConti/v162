title: 'Augment with Care: Contrastive Learning for Combinatorial Problems'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Supervised learning can improve the design of state-of-the-art solvers for
  combinatorial problems, but labelling large numbers of combinatorial instances is
  often impractical due to exponential worst-case complexity. Inspired by the recent
  success of contrastive pre-training for images, we conduct a scientific study of
  the effect of augmentation design on contrastive pre-training for the Boolean satisfiability
  problem. While typical graph contrastive pre-training uses label-agnostic augmentations,
  our key insight is that many combinatorial problems have well-studied invariances,
  which allow for the design of label-preserving augmentations. We find that label-preserving
  augmentations are critical for the success of contrastive pre-training. We show
  that our representations are able to achieve comparable test accuracy to fully-supervised
  learning while using only 1% of the labels. We also demonstrate that our representations
  are more transferable to larger problems from unseen domains. Our code is available
  at https://github.com/h4duan/contrastive-sat.
