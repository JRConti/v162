title: Structural Entropy Guided Graph Hierarchical Pooling
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Following the success of convolution on non-Euclidean space, the corresponding
  pooling approaches have also been validated on various tasks regarding graphs. However,
  because of the fixed compression ratio and stepwise pooling design, these hierarchical
  pooling methods still suffer from local structure damage and suboptimal problem.
  In this work, inspired by structural entropy, we propose a hierarchical pooling
  approach, SEP, to tackle the two issues. Specifically, without assigning the layer-specific
  compression ratio, a global optimization algorithm is designed to generate the cluster
  assignment matrices for pooling at once. Then, we present an illustration of the
  local structure damage from previous methods in reconstruction of ring and grid
  synthetic graphs. In addition to SEP, we further design two classification models,
  SEP-G and SEP-N for graph classification and node classification, respectively.
  The results show that SEP outperforms state-of-the-art graph pooling methods on
  graph classification benchmarks and obtains superior performance on node classifications.
