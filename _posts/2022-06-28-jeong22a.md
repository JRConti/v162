title: An Exact Symbolic Reduction of Linear Smart Predict+Optimize to Mixed Integer
  Linear Programming
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Predictive models are traditionally optimized independently of their use
  in downstream decision-based optimization. The ‘smart, predict then optimize’ (SPO)
  framework addresses this shortcoming by optimizing predictive models in order to
  <em>minimize</em> the final downstream decision loss. To date, several local first-order
  methods and convex approximations have been proposed. These methods have proven
  to be effective in practice, however, it remains generally unclear as to how close
  these local solutions are to global optimality. In this paper, we cast the SPO problem
  as a bi-level program and apply Symbolic Variable Elimination (SVE) to analytically
  solve the lower optimization. The resulting program can then be formulated as a
  mixed-integer linear program (MILP) which is solved to global optimality using standard
  off-the-shelf solvers. To our knowledge, our framework is the first to provide a
  globally optimal solution to the linear SPO problem. Experimental results comparing
  with state-of-the-art local SPO solvers show that the globally optimal solution
  obtains up to <em>two orders of magnitude reduction</em> in decision regret.
