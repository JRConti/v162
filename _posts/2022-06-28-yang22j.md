title: 'Not All Poisons are Created Equal: Robust Training against Data Poisoning'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Data poisoning causes misclassification of test time target examples, by
  injecting maliciously crafted samples in the training data. Existing defenses are
  often effective only against a specific type of targeted attack, significantly degrade
  the generalization performance, or are prohibitive for standard deep learning pipelines.
  In this work, we propose an efficient defense mechanism that significantly reduces
  the success rate of various data poisoning attacks, and provides theoretical guarantees
  for the performance of the model. Targeted attacks work by adding bounded perturbations
  to a randomly selected subset of training data to match the targetsâ€™ gradient or
  representation. We show that: (i) under bounded perturbations, only a number of
  poisons can be optimized to have a gradient that is close enough to that of the
  target and make the attack successful; (ii) such effective poisons move away from
  their original class and get isolated in the gradient space; (iii) dropping examples
  in low-density gradient regions during training can successfully eliminate the effective
  poisons, and guarantees similar training dynamics to that of training on full data.
  Our extensive experiments show that our method significantly decreases the success
  rate of state-of-the-art targeted attacks, including Gradient Matching and Bullseye
  Polytope, and easily scales to large datasets.'
