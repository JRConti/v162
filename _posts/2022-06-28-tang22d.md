title: 'Virtual Homogeneity Learning: Defending against Data Heterogeneity in Federated
  Learning'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'In federated learning (FL), model performance typically suffers from client
  drift induced by data heterogeneity, and mainstream works focus on correcting client
  drift. We propose a different approach named virtual homogeneity learning (VHL)
  to directly “rectify” the data heterogeneity. In particular, VHL conducts FL with
  a virtual homogeneous dataset crafted to satisfy two conditions: containing <em>no</em>
  private information and being separable. The virtual dataset can be generated from
  pure noise shared across clients, aiming to calibrate the features from the heterogeneous
  clients. Theoretically, we prove that VHL can achieve provable generalization performance
  on the natural distribution. Empirically, we demonstrate that VHL endows FL with
  drastically improved convergence speed and generalization performance. VHL is the
  first attempt towards using a virtual dataset to address data heterogeneity, offering
  new and effective means to FL.'
