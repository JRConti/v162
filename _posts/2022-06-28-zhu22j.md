title: Region-Based Semantic Factorization in GANs
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Despite the rapid advancement of semantic discovery in the latent space
  of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), existing approaches either are limited
  to finding global attributes or rely on a number of segmentation masks to identify
  local attributes. In this work, we present a highly efficient algorithm to factorize
  the latent semantics learned by GANs concerning an arbitrary image region. Concretely,
  we revisit the task of local manipulation with pre-trained GANs and formulate region-based
  semantic discovery as a dual optimization problem. Through an appropriately defined
  generalized Rayleigh quotient, we manage to solve such a problem without any annotations
  or training. Experimental results on various state-of-the-art GAN models demonstrate
  the effectiveness of our approach, as well as its superiority over prior arts regarding
  precise control, region robustness, speed of implementation, and simplicity of use.
