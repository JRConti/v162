title: A Unified View on PAC-Bayes Bounds for Meta-Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Meta learning automatically infers an inductive bias, that includes the
  hyperparameter of the baselearning algorithm, by observing data from a finite number
  of related tasks. This paper studies PAC-Bayes bounds on meta generalization gap.
  The meta-generalization gap comprises two sources of generalization gaps: the environmentlevel
  and task-level gaps resulting from observation of a finite number of tasks and data
  samples per task, respectively. In this paper, by upper bounding arbitrary convex
  functions, which link the expected and empirical losses at the environment and also
  per-task levels, we obtain new PAC-Bayes bounds. Using these bounds, we develop
  new PAC-Bayes meta-learning algorithms. Numerical examples demonstrate the merits
  of the proposed novel bounds and algorithm in comparison to prior PAC-Bayes bounds
  for meta-learning'
