title: 'CtrlFormer: Learning Transferable State Representation for Visual Control
  via Transformer'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Transformer has achieved great successes in learning vision and language
  representation, which is general across various downstream tasks. In visual control,
  learning transferable state representation that can transfer between different control
  tasks is important to reduce the training sample size. However, porting Transformer
  to sample-efficient visual control remains a challenging and unsolved problem. To
  this end, we propose a novel Control Transformer (CtrlFormer), possessing many appealing
  benefits that prior arts do not have. Firstly, CtrlFormer jointly learns self-attention
  mechanisms between visual tokens and policy tokens among different control tasks,
  where multitask representation can be learned and transferred without catastrophic
  forgetting. Secondly, we carefully design a contrastive reinforcement learning paradigm
  to train CtrlFormer, enabling it to achieve high sample efficiency, which is important
  in control problems. For example, in the DMControl benchmark, unlike recent advanced
  methods that failed by producing a zero score in the “Cartpole” task after transfer
  learning with 100k samples, CtrlFormer can achieve a state-of-the-art score with
  only 100k samples while maintaining the performance of previous tasks. The code
  and models are released in our project homepage.
