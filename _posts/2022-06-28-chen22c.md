title: The Fundamental Price of Secure Aggregation in Differentially Private Federated
  Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We consider the problem of training a $d$ dimensional model with distributed
  differential privacy (DP) where secure aggregation (SecAgg) is used to ensure that
  the server only sees the noisy sum of $n$ model updates in every training round.
  Taking into account the constraints imposed by SecAgg, we characterize the fundamental
  communication cost required to obtain the best accuracy achievable under $\varepsilon$
  central DP (i.e. under a fully trusted server and no communication constraints).
  Our results show that $\tilde{O}\lp \min(n^2\varepsilon^2, d) \rp$ bits per client
  are both sufficient and necessary, and this fundamental limit can be achieved by
  a linear scheme based on sparse random projections. This provides a significant
  improvement relative to state-of-the-art SecAgg distributed DP schemes which use
  $\tilde{O}(d\log(d/\varepsilon^2))$ bits per client. Empirically, we evaluate our
  proposed scheme on real-world federated learning tasks. We find that our theoretical
  analysis is well matched in practice. In particular, we show that we can reduce
  the communication cost to under $1.78$ bits per parameter in realistic privacy settings
  without decreasing test-time performance. Our work hence theoretically and empirically
  specifies the fundamental price of using SecAgg.
