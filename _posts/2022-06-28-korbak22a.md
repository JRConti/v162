title: Controlling Conditional Language Models without Catastrophic Forgetting
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Machine learning is shifting towards general-purpose pretrained generative
  models, trained in a self-supervised manner on large amounts of data, which can
  then be applied to solve a large number of tasks. However, due to their generic
  training methodology, these models often fail to meet some of the downstream requirements
  (e.g., hallucinations in abstractive summarization or style violations in code generation).
  This raises the important question of how to adapt pre-trained generative models
  to meet all requirements without destroying their general capabilities ("catastrophic
  forgetting"). Recent work has proposed to solve this problem by representing task-specific
  requirements through energy-based models (EBMs) and approximating these EBMs using
  distributional policy gradients (DPG). Despite its effectiveness, this approach
  is however limited to unconditional distributions. In this paper, we extend DPG
  to conditional tasks by proposing Conditional DPG (CDPG). We evaluate CDPG on four
  different control objectives across three tasks (translation, summarization and
  code generation) and two pretrained models (T5 and GPT-Neo). Our results show that
  fine-tuning using CDPG robustly moves these pretrained models closer towards meeting
  control objectives and — in contrast with baseline approaches — does not result
  in catastrophic forgetting.
