title: 'PACE: A Parallelizable Computation Encoder for Directed Acyclic Graphs'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Optimization of directed acyclic graph (DAG) structures has many applications,
  such as neural architecture search (NAS) and probabilistic graphical model learning.
  Encoding DAGs into real vectors is a dominant component in most neural-network-based
  DAG optimization frameworks. Currently, most popular DAG encoders use an asynchronous
  message passing scheme which sequentially processes nodes according to the dependency
  between nodes in a DAG. That is, a node must not be processed until all its predecessors
  are processed. As a result, they are inherently not parallelizable. In this work,
  we propose a Parallelizable Attention-based Computation structure Encoder (PACE)
  that processes nodes simultaneously and encodes DAGs in parallel. We demonstrate
  the superiority of PACE through encoder-dependent optimization subroutines that
  search the optimal DAG structure based on the learned DAG embeddings. Experiments
  show that PACE not only improves the effectiveness over previous sequential DAG
  encoders with a significantly boosted training and inference speed, but also generates
  smooth latent (DAG encoding) spaces that are beneficial to downstream optimization
  subroutines.
