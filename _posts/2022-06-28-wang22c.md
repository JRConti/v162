title: 'Denoised MDPs: Learning World Models Better Than the World Itself'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'The ability to separate signal from noise, and reason with clean abstractions,
  is critical to intelligence. With this ability, humans can efficiently perform real
  world tasks without considering all possible nuisance factors. How can artificial
  agents do the same? What kind of information can agents safely discard as noises?
  In this work, we categorize information out in the wild into four types based on
  controllability and relation with reward, and formulate useful information as that
  which is both controllable and reward-relevant. This framework clarifies the kinds
  information removed by various prior work on representation learning in reinforcement
  learning (RL), and leads to our proposed approach of learning a Denoised MDP that
  explicitly factors out certain noise distractors. Extensive experiments on variants
  of DeepMind Control Suite and RoboDesk demonstrate superior performance of our denoised
  world model over using raw observations alone, and over prior works, across policy
  optimization control tasks as well as the non-control task of joint position regression.
