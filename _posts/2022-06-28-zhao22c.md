title: Dynamic Regret of Online Markov Decision Processes
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We investigate online Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with adversarially
  changing loss functions and known transitions. We choose <em>dynamic regret</em>
  as the performance measure, defined as the performance difference between the learner
  and any sequence of feasible <em>changing</em> policies. The measure is strictly
  stronger than the standard static regret that benchmarks the learner’s performance
  with a fixed compared policy. We consider three foundational models of online MDPs,
  including episodic loop-free Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP), episodic SSP, and infinite-horizon
  MDPs. For the three models, we propose novel online ensemble algorithms and establish
  their dynamic regret guarantees respectively, in which the results for episodic
  (loop-free) SSP are provably minimax optimal in terms of time horizon and certain
  non-stationarity measure.
