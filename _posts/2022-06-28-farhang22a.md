title: Investigating Generalization by Controlling Normalized Margin
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Weight norm \|W\|{and} margin $\gamma$ participate in learning theory via
  the normalized margin $\gamma$/\|W\|. Since standard neural net optimizers do not
  control normalized margin, it is hard to test whether this quantity causally relates
  to generalization. This paper designs a series of experimental studies that explicitly
  control normalized margin and thereby tackle two central questions. First: does
  normalized margin always have a causal effect on generalization? The paper finds
  that no{—}networks can be produced where normalized margin has seemingly no relationship
  with generalization, counter to the theory of Bartlett et al. (2017). Second: does
  normalized margin ever have a causal effect on generalization? The paper finds that
  yes{—}in a standard training setup, test performance closely tracks normalized margin.
  The paper suggests a Gaussian process model as a promising explanation for this
  behavior.'
