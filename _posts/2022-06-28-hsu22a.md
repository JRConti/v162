title: Learning inverse folding from millions of predicted structures
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We consider the problem of predicting a protein sequence from its backbone
  atom coordinates. Machine learning approaches to this problem to date have been
  limited by the number of available experimentally determined protein structures.
  We augment training data by nearly three orders of magnitude by predicting structures
  for 12M protein sequences using AlphaFold2. Trained with this additional data, a
  sequence-to-sequence transformer with invariant geometric input processing layers
  achieves 51% native sequence recovery on structurally held-out backbones with 72%
  recovery for buried residues, an overall improvement of almost 10 percentage points
  over existing methods. The model generalizes to a variety of more complex tasks
  including design of protein complexes, partially masked structures, binding interfaces,
  and multiple states.
