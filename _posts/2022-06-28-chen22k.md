title: On Collective Robustness of Bagging Against Data Poisoning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Bootstrap aggregating (bagging) is an effective ensemble protocol, which
  is believed can enhance robustness by its majority voting mechanism. Recent works
  further prove the sample-wise robustness certificates for certain forms of bagging
  (e.g. partition aggregation). Beyond these particular forms, in this paper, we propose
  the first collective certification for general bagging to compute the tight robustness
  against the global poisoning attack. Specifically, we compute the maximum number
  of simultaneously changed predictions via solving a binary integer linear programming
  (BILP) problem. Then we analyze the robustness of vanilla bagging and give the upper
  bound of the tolerable poison budget. Based on this analysis, we propose hash bagging
  to improve the robustness of vanilla bagging almost for free. This is achieved by
  modifying the random subsampling in vanilla bagging to a hash-based deterministic
  subsampling, as a way of controlling the influence scope for each poisoning sample
  universally. Our extensive experiments show the notable advantage in terms of applicability
  and robustness. Our code is available at https://github.com/Emiyalzn/ICML22-CRB.
