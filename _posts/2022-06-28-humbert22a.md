title: Robust Kernel Density Estimation with Median-of-Means principle
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In this paper, we introduce a robust non-parametric density estimator combining
  the popular Kernel Density Estimation method and the Median-of-Means principle (MoM-KDE).
  This estimator is shown to achieve robustness for a large class of anomalous data,
  potentially adversarial. In particular, while previous works only prove consistency
  results under very specific contamination models, this work provides finite-sample
  high-probability error-bounds without any prior knowledge on the outliers. To highlight
  the robustness of our method, we introduce an influence function adapted to the
  considered OUI framework. Finally, we show that MoM-KDE achieves competitive results
  when compared with other robust kernel estimators, while having significantly lower
  computational complexity.
