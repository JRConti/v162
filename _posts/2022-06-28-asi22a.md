abstract: 'In non-private stochastic convex optimization, stochastic gradient methods
  converge much faster on interpolation problems—namely, problems where there exists
  a solution that simultaneously minimizes all of the sample losses—than on non-interpolating
  ones; similar improvements are not known in the private setting. In this paper,
  we investigate differentially private stochastic optimization in the interpolation
  regime. First, we show that without additional assumptions, interpolation problems
  do not exhibit an improved convergence rates with differential privacy. However,
  when the functions exhibit quadratic growth around the optimum, we show (near) exponential
  improvements in the private sample complexity. In particular, we propose an adaptive
  algorithm that improves the sample complexity to achieve expected error $\alpha$
  from $\frac{d}{\diffp \sqrt{\alpha}}$ to $\frac{1}{\alpha^\rho} + \frac{d}{\diffp}
  \log\paren{\frac{1}{\alpha}}$ for any fixed $\rho >0$, while retaining the standard
  minimax-optimal sample complexity for non-interpolation problems. We prove a lower
  bound that shows the dimension-dependent term in the expression above is tight.
  Furthermore, we provide a superefficiency result which demonstrates the necessity
  of the polynomial term for adaptive algorithms: any algorithm that has a polylogarithmic
  sample complexity for interpolation problems cannot achieve the minimax-optimal
  rates for the family of non-interpolation problems.'
