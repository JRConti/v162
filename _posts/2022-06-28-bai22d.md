title: 'A$^3$T: Alignment-Aware Acoustic and Text Pretraining for Speech Synthesis
  and Editing'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Recently, speech representation learning has improved many speech-related
  tasks such as speech recognition, speech classification, and speech-to-text translation.
  However, all the above tasks are in the direction of speech understanding, but for
  the inverse direction, speech synthesis, the potential of representation learning
  is yet to be realized, due to the challenging nature of generating high-quality
  speech. To address this problem, we propose our framework, Alignment-Aware Acoustic-Text
  Pretraining (A$^3$T), which reconstructs masked acoustic signals with text input
  and acoustic-text alignment during training. In this way, the pretrained model can
  generate high quality reconstructed spectrogram, which can be applied to the speech
  editing and unseen speaker TTS directly. Experiments show A$^3$T outperforms SOTA
  models on speech editing, and improves multi-speaker speech synthesis without the
  external speaker verification model.
