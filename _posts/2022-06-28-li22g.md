title: Phasic Self-Imitative Reduction for Sparse-Reward Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement
  Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: It has been a recent trend to leverage the power of supervised learning
  (SL) towards more effective reinforcement learning (RL) methods. We propose a novel
  phasic solution by alternating online RL and offline SL for tackling sparse-reward
  goal-conditioned problems. In the online phase, we perform RL training and collect
  rollout data while in the offline phase, we perform SL on those successful trajectories
  from the dataset. To further improve sample efficiency, we adopt additional techniques
  in the online phase including task reduction to generate more feasible trajectories
  and a value-difference-based intrinsic reward to alleviate the sparse-reward issue.
  We call this overall framework, PhAsic self-Imitative Reduction (PAIR). PAIR is
  compatible with various online and offline RL methods and substantially outperforms
  both non-phasic RL and phasic SL baselines on sparse-reward robotic control problems,
  including a particularly challenging stacking task. PAIR is the first RL method
  that learns to stack 6 cubes with only 0/1 success rewards from scratch.
