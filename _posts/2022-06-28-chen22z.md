title: Optimization-Induced Graph Implicit Nonlinear Diffusion
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Due to the over-smoothing issue, most existing graph neural networks can
  only capture limited dependencies with their inherently finite aggregation layers.
  To overcome this limitation, we propose a new kind of graph convolution, called
  Graph Implicit Nonlinear Diffusion (GIND), which implicitly has access to infinite
  hops of neighbors while adaptively aggregating features with nonlinear diffusion
  to prevent over-smoothing. Notably, we show that the learned representation can
  be formalized as the minimizer of an explicit convex optimization objective. With
  this property, we can theoretically characterize the equilibrium of our GIND from
  an optimization perspective. More interestingly, we can induce new structural variants
  by modifying the corresponding optimization objective. To be specific, we can embed
  prior properties to the equilibrium, as well as introducing skip connections to
  promote training stability. Extensive experiments show that GIND is good at capturing
  long-range dependencies, and performs well on both homophilic and heterophilic graphs
  with nonlinear diffusion. Moreover, we show that the optimization-induced variants
  of our models can boost the performance and improve training stability and efficiency
  as well. As a result, our GIND obtains significant improvements on both node-level
  and graph-level tasks.
