title: Robust Deep Reinforcement Learning through Bootstrapped Opportunistic Curriculum
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Despite considerable advances in deep reinforcement learning, it has been
  shown to be highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations to state observations.
  Recent efforts that have attempted to improve adversarial robustness of reinforcement
  learning can nevertheless tolerate only very small perturbations, and remain fragile
  as perturbation size increases. We propose Bootstrapped Opportunistic Adversarial
  Curriculum Learning (BCL), a novel flexible adversarial curriculum learning framework
  for robust reinforcement learning. Our framework combines two ideas: conservatively
  bootstrapping each curriculum phase with highest quality solutions obtained from
  multiple runs of the previous phase, and opportunistically skipping forward in the
  curriculum. In our experiments we show that the proposed BCL framework enables dramatic
  improvements in robustness of learned policies to adversarial perturbations. The
  greatest improvement is for Pong, where our framework yields robustness to perturbations
  of up to 25/255; in contrast, the best existing approach can only tolerate adversarial
  noise up to 5/255. Our code is available at: https://github.com/jlwu002/BCL.'
