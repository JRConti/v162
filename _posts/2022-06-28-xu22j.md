title: A Difference Standardization Method for Mutual Transfer Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In many real-world applications, mutual transfer learning is the paradigm
  that each data domain can potentially be a source or target domain. This is quite
  different from transfer learning tasks where the source and target are known a priori.
  However, previous studies about mutual transfer learning either suffer from high
  computational complexity or oversimplified hypothesis. To overcome these challenges,
  in this paper, we propose the \underline{Diff}erence \underline{S}tandardization
  method ({\bf DiffS}) for mutual transfer learning. Specifically, we put forward
  a novel distance metric between domains, the standardized domain difference, to
  obtain fast structure recovery and accurate parameter estimation simultaneously.
  We validate the methodâ€™s performance using both synthetic and real-world data. Compared
  to previous methods, DiffS demonstrates a speed-up of approximately 3000 times that
  of similar methods and achieves the same accurate learnability structure estimation.
