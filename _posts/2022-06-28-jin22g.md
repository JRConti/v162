title: Input-agnostic Certified Group Fairness via Gaussian Parameter Smoothing
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Only recently, researchers attempt to provide classification algorithms
  with provable group fairness guarantees. Most of these algorithms suffer from harassment
  caused by the requirement that the training and deployment data follow the same
  distribution. This paper proposes an input-agnostic certified group fairness algorithm,
  FairSmooth, for improving the fairness of classification models while maintaining
  the remarkable prediction accuracy. A Gaussian parameter smoothing method is developed
  to transform base classifiers into their smooth versions. An optimal individual
  smooth classifier is learnt for each group with only the data regarding the group
  and an overall smooth classifier for all groups is generated by averaging the parameters
  of all the individual smooth ones. By leveraging the theory of nonlinear functional
  analysis, the smooth classifiers are reformulated as output functions of a Nemytskii
  operator. Theoretical analysis is conducted to derive that the Nemytskii operator
  is smooth and induces a Frechet differentiable smooth manifold. We theoretically
  demonstrate that the smooth manifold has a global Lipschitz constant that is independent
  of the domain of the input data, which derives the input-agnostic certified group
  fairness.
