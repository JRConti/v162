title: Secure Distributed Training at Scale
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Many areas of deep learning benefit from using increasingly larger neural
  networks trained on public data, as is the case for pre-trained models for NLP and
  computer vision. Training such models requires a lot of computational resources
  (e.g., HPC clusters) that are not available to small research groups and independent
  researchers. One way to address it is for several smaller groups to pool their computational
  resources together and train a model that benefits all participants. Unfortunately,
  in this case, any participant can jeopardize the entire training run by sending
  incorrect updates, deliberately or by mistake. Training in presence of such peers
  requires specialized distributed training algorithms with Byzantine tolerance. These
  algorithms often sacrifice efficiency by introducing redundant communication or
  passing all updates through a trusted server, making it infeasible to apply them
  to large-scale deep learning, where models can have billions of parameters. In this
  work, we propose a novel protocol for secure (Byzantine-tolerant) decentralized
  training that emphasizes communication efficiency.
