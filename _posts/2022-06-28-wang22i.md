title: 'DynaMixer: A Vision MLP Architecture with Dynamic Mixing'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Recently, MLP-like vision models have achieved promising performances on
  mainstream visual recognition tasks. In contrast with vision transformers and CNNs,
  the success of MLP-like models shows that simple information fusion operations among
  tokens and channels can yield a good representation power for deep recognition models.
  However, existing MLP-like models fuse tokens through static fusion operations,
  lacking adaptability to the contents of the tokens to be mixed. Thus, customary
  information fusion procedures are not effective enough. To this end, this paper
  presents an efficient MLP-like network architecture, dubbed DynaMixer, resorting
  to dynamic information fusion. Critically, we propose a procedure, on which the
  DynaMixer model relies, to dynamically generate mixing matrices by leveraging the
  contents of all the tokens to be mixed. To reduce the time complexity and improve
  the robustness, a dimensionality reduction technique and a multi-segment fusion
  mechanism are adopted. Our proposed DynaMixer model (97M parameters) achieves 84.3%
  top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset without extra training data, performing
  favorably against the state-of-the-art vision MLP models. When the number of parameters
  is reduced to 26M, it still achieves 82.7% top-1 accuracy, surpassing the existing
  MLP-like models with a similar capacity. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/ziyuwwang/DynaMixer}.
