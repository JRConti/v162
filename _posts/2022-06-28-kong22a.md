title: Partial disentanglement for domain adaptation
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Unsupervised domain adaptation is critical to many real-world applications
  where label information is unavailable in the target domain. In general, without
  further assumptions, the joint distribution of the features and the label is not
  identifiable in the target domain. To address this issue, we rely on a property
  of minimal changes of causal mechanisms across domains to minimize unnecessary influences
  of domain shift. To encode this property, we first formulate the data generating
  process using a latent variable model with two partitioned latent subspaces: invariant
  components whose distributions stay the same across domains, and sparse changing
  components that vary across domains. We further constrain the domain shift to have
  a restrictive influence on the changing components. Under mild conditions, we show
  that the latent variables are partially identifiable, from which it follows that
  the joint distribution of data and labels in the target domain is also identifiable.
  Given the theoretical insights, we propose a practical domain adaptation framework,
  called iMSDA. Extensive experimental results reveal that iMSDA outperforms state-of-the-art
  domain adaptation algorithms on benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness
  of our framework.'
