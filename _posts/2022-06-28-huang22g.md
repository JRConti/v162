  Design'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Deep learning has achieved tremendous success in designing novel chemical
  compounds with desirable pharmaceutical properties. In this work, we focus on a
  new type of drug design problem — generating a small “linker” to physically attach
  two independent molecules with their distinct functions. The main computational
  challenges include: 1) the generation of linkers is conditional on the two given
  molecules, in contrast to generating complete molecules from scratch in previous
  works; 2) linkers heavily depend on the anchor atoms of the two molecules to be
  connected, which are not known beforehand; 3) 3D structures and orientations of
  the molecules need to be considered to avoid atom clashes, for which equivariance
  to E(3) group are necessary. To address these problems, we propose a conditional
  generative model, named 3DLinker, which is able to predict anchor atoms and jointly
  generate linker graphs and their 3D structures based on an E(3) equivariant graph
  variational autoencoder. So far as we know, no previous models could achieve this
  task. We compare our model with multiple conditional generative models modified
  from other molecular design tasks and find that our model has a significantly higher
  rate in recovering molecular graphs, and more importantly, accurately predicting
  the 3D coordinates of all the atoms.'
