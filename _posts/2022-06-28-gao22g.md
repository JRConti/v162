title: 'Rethinking Image-Scaling Attacks: The Interplay Between Vulnerabilities in
  Machine Learning Systems'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: As real-world images come in varying sizes, the machine learning model is
  part of a larger system that includes an upstream image scaling algorithm. In this
  paper, we investigate the interplay between vulnerabilities of the image scaling
  procedure and machine learning models in the decision-based black-box setting. We
  propose a novel sampling strategy to make a black-box attack exploit vulnerabilities
  in scaling algorithms, scaling defenses, and the final machine learning model in
  an end-to-end manner. Based on this scaling-aware attack, we reveal that most existing
  scaling defenses are ineffective under threat from downstream models. Moreover,
  we empirically observe that standard black-box attacks can significantly improve
  their performance by exploiting the vulnerable scaling procedure. We further demonstrate
  this problem on a commercial Image Analysis API with decision-based black-box attacks.
