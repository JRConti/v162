title: Partial Label Learning via Label Influence Function
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: To deal with ambiguities in partial label learning (PLL), state-of-the-art
  strategies implement disambiguations by identifying the ground-truth label directly
  from the candidate label set. However, these approaches usually take the label that
  incurs a minimal loss as the ground-truth label or use the weight to represent which
  label has a high likelihood to be the ground-truth label. Little work has been done
  to investigate from the perspective of how a candidate label changing a predictive
  model. In this paper, inspired by influence function, we develop a novel PLL framework
  called Partial Label Learning via Label Influence Function (PLL-IF). Moreover, we
  implement the framework with two specific representative models, an SVM model and
  a neural network model, which are called PLL-IF+SVM and PLL-IF+NN method respectively.
  Extensive experiments conducted on various datasets demonstrate the superiorities
  of the proposed methods in terms of prediction accuracy, which in turn validates
  the effectiveness of the proposed PLL-IF framework.
