title: Unsupervised Flow-Aligned Sequence-to-Sequence Learning for Video Restoration
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: How to properly model the inter-frame relation within the video sequence
  is an important but unsolved challenge for video restoration (VR). In this work,
  we propose an unsupervised flow-aligned sequence-to-sequence model (S2SVR) to address
  this problem. On the one hand, the sequence-to-sequence model, which has proven
  capable of sequence modeling in the field of natural language processing, is explored
  for the first time in VR. Optimized serialization modeling shows potential in capturing
  long-range dependencies among frames. On the other hand, we equip the sequence-to-sequence
  model with an unsupervised optical flow estimator to maximize its potential. The
  flow estimator is trained with our proposed unsupervised distillation loss, which
  can alleviate the data discrepancy and inaccurate degraded optical flow issues of
  previous flow-based methods. With reliable optical flow, we can establish accurate
  correspondence among multiple frames, narrowing the domain difference between 1D
  language and 2D misaligned frames and improving the potential of the sequence-to-sequence
  model. S2SVR shows superior performance in multiple VR tasks, including video deblurring,
  video super-resolution, and compressed video quality enhancement. https://github.com/linjing7/VR-Baseline
