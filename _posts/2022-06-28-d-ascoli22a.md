title: Deep symbolic regression for recurrence prediction
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Symbolic regression, i.e. predicting a function from the observation of
  its values, is well-known to be a challenging task. In this paper, we train Transformers
  to infer the function or recurrence relation underlying sequences of integers or
  floats, a typical task in human IQ tests which has hardly been tackled in the machine
  learning literature. We evaluate our integer model on a subset of OEIS sequences,
  and show that it outperforms built-in Mathematica functions for recurrence prediction.
  We also demonstrate that our float model is able to yield informative approximations
  of out-of-vocabulary functions and constants, e.g. $\operatorname{bessel0}(x)\approx
  \frac{\sin(x)+\cos(x)}{\sqrt{\pi x}}$ and $1.644934\approx \pi^2/6$.
