title: Local Augmentation for Graph Neural Networks
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable performance on graph-based
  tasks. The key idea for GNNs is to obtain informative representation through aggregating
  information from local neighborhoods. However, it remains an open question whether
  the neighborhood information is adequately aggregated for learning representations
  of nodes with few neighbors. To address this, we propose a simple and efficient
  data augmentation strategy, local augmentation, to learn the distribution of the
  node representations of the neighbors conditioned on the central node’s representation
  and enhance GNN’s expressive power with generated features. Local augmentation is
  a general framework that can be applied to any GNN model in a plug-and-play manner.
  It samples feature vectors associated with each node from the learned conditional
  distribution as additional input for the backbone model at each training iteration.
  Extensive experiments and analyses show that local augmentation consistently yields
  performance improvement when applied to various GNN architectures across a diverse
  set of benchmarks. For example, experiments show that plugging in local augmentation
  to GCN and GAT improves by an average of 3.4% and 1.6% in terms of test accuracy
  on Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed. Besides, our experimental results on large graphs
  (OGB) show that our model consistently improves performance over backbones. Code
