title: 'Reinforcement Learning from Partial Observation: Linear Function Approximation
  with Provable Sample Efficiency'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'We study reinforcement learning for partially observed Markov decision
  processes (POMDPs) with infinite observation and state spaces, which remains less
  investigated theoretically. To this end, we make the first attempt at bridging partial
  observability and function approximation for a class of POMDPs with a linear structure.
  In detail, we propose a reinforcement learning algorithm (Optimistic Exploration
  via Adversarial Integral Equation or OP-TENET) that attains an $\epsilon$-optimal
  policy within $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ episodes. In particular, the sample complexity scales
  polynomially in the intrinsic dimension of the linear structure and is independent
  of the size of the observation and state spaces. The sample efficiency of OP-TENET
  is enabled by a sequence of ingredients: (i) a Bellman operator with finite memory,
  which represents the value function in a recursive manner, (ii) the identification
  and estimation of such an operator via an adversarial integral equation, which features
  a smoothed discriminator tailored to the linear structure, and (iii) the exploration
  of the observation and state spaces via optimism, which is based on quantifying
  the uncertainty in the adversarial integral equation.'
