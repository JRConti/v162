title: Principal Component Flows
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Normalizing flows map an independent set of latent variables to their samples
  using a bijective transformation. Despite the exact correspondence between samples
  and latent variables, their high level relationship is not well understood. In this
  paper we characterize the geometric structure of flows using principal manifolds
  and understand the relationship between latent variables and samples using contours.
  We introduce a novel class of normalizing flows, called principal component flows
  (PCF), whose contours are its principal manifolds, and a variant for injective flows
  (iPCF) that is more efficient to train than regular injective flows. PCFs can be
  constructed using any flow architecture, are trained with a regularized maximum
  likelihood objective and can perform density estimation on all of their principal
  manifolds. In our experiments we show that PCFs and iPCFs are able to learn the
  principal manifolds over a variety of datasets. Additionally, we show that PCFs
  can perform density estimation on data that lie on a manifold with variable dimensionality,
  which is not possible with existing normalizing flows.
