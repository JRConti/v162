title: How Faithful is your Synthetic Data? Sample-level Metrics for Evaluating and
  Auditing Generative Models
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Devising domain- and model-agnostic evaluation metrics for generative models
  is an important and as yet unresolved problem. Most existing metrics, which were
  tailored solely to the image synthesis setup, exhibit a limited capacity for diagnosing
  the different modes of failure of generative models across broader application domains.
  In this paper, we introduce a 3-dimensional evaluation metric, ($\alpha$-Precision,
  $\beta$-Recall, Authenticity), that characterizes the fidelity, diversity and generalization
  performance of any generative model in a domain-agnostic fashion. Our metric unifies
  statistical divergence measures with precision-recall analysis, enabling sample-
  and distribution-level diagnoses of model fidelity and diversity. We introduce generalization
  as an additional, independent dimension (to the fidelity-diversity trade-off) that
  quantifies the extent to which a model copies training data{â€”}a crucial performance
  indicator when modeling sensitive data with requirements on privacy. The three metric
  components correspond to (interpretable) probabilistic quantities, and are estimated
  via sample-level binary classification. The sample-level nature of our metric inspires
  a novel use case which we call model auditing, wherein we judge the quality of individual
  samples generated by a (black-box) model, discarding low-quality samples and hence
  improving the overall model performance in a post-hoc manner.
