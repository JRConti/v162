title: Toward Compositional Generalization in Object-Oriented World Modeling
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Compositional generalization is a critical ability in learning and decision-making.
  We focus on the setting of reinforcement learning in object-oriented environments
  to study compositional generalization in world modeling. We (1) formalize the compositional
  generalization problem with an algebraic approach and (2) study how a world model
  can achieve that. We introduce a conceptual environment, Object Library, and two
  instances, and deploy a principled pipeline to measure the generalization ability.
  Motivated by the formulation, we analyze several methods with exact or no compositional
  generalization ability using our framework, and design a differentiable approach,
  Homomorphic Object-oriented World Model (HOWM), that achieves soft but more efficient
  compositional generalization.
