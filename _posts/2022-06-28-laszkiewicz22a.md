title: Marginal Tail-Adaptive Normalizing Flows
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Learning the tail behavior of a distribution is a notoriously difficult
  problem. By definition, the number of samples from the tail is small, and deep generative
  models, such as normalizing flows, tend to concentrate on learning the body of the
  distribution. In this paper, we focus on improving the ability of normalizing flows
  to correctly capture the tail behavior and, thus, form more accurate models. We
  prove that the marginal tailedness of an autoregressive flow can be controlled via
  the tailedness of the marginals of its base distribution. This theoretical insight
  leads us to a novel type of flows based on flexible base distributions and data-driven
  linear layers. An empirical analysis shows that the proposed method improves on
  the accuracy{—}especially on the tails of the distribution{—}and is able to generate
  heavy-tailed data. We demonstrate its application on a weather and climate example,
  in which capturing the tail behavior is essential.
