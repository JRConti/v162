title: Bayesian Imitation Learning for End-to-End Mobile Manipulation
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In this work we investigate and demonstrate benefits of a Bayesian approach
  to imitation learning from multiple sensor inputs, as applied to the task of opening
  office doors with a mobile manipulator. Augmenting policies with additional sensor
  inputs{—}such as RGB + depth cameras{—}is a straightforward approach to improving
  robot perception capabilities, especially for tasks that may favor different sensors
  in different situations. As we scale multi-sensor robotic learning to unstructured
  real-world settings (e.g. offices, homes) and more complex robot behaviors, we also
  increase reliance on simulators for cost, efficiency, and safety. Consequently,
  the sim-to-real gap across multiple sensor modalities also increases, making simulated
  validation more difficult. We show that using the Variational Information Bottleneck
  (Alemi et al., 2016) to regularize convolutional neural networks improves generalization
  to heldout domains and reduces the sim-to-real gap in a sensor-agnostic manner.
  As a side effect, the learned embeddings also provide useful estimates of model
  uncertainty for each sensor. We demonstrate that our method is able to help close
  the sim-to-real gap and successfully fuse RGB and depth modalities based on understanding
  of the situational uncertainty of each sensor. In a real-world office environment,
  we achieve 96% task success, improving upon the baseline by +16%.
