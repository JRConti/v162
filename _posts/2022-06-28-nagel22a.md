title: Overcoming Oscillations in Quantization-Aware Training
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'When training neural networks with simulated quantization, we observe that
  quantized weights can, rather unexpectedly, oscillate between two grid-points. The
  importance of this effect and its impact on quantization-aware training (QAT) are
  not well-understood or investigated in literature. In this paper, we delve deeper
  into the phenomenon of weight oscillations and show that it can lead to a significant
  accuracy degradation due to wrongly estimated batch-normalization statistics during
  inference and increased noise during training. These effects are particularly pronounced
  in low-bit ($\leq$ 4-bits) quantization of efficient networks with depth-wise separable
  layers, such as MobileNets and EfficientNets. In our analysis we investigate several
  previously proposed QAT algorithms and show that most of these are unable to overcome
  oscillations. Finally, we propose two novel QAT algorithms to overcome oscillations
  during training: oscillation dampening and iterative weight freezing. We demonstrate
  that our algorithms achieve state-of-the-art accuracy for low-bit (3 & 4 bits) weight
  and activation quantization of efficient architectures, such as MobileNetV2, MobileNetV3,
  and EfficentNet-lite on ImageNet. Our source code is available at https://github.com/qualcomm-ai-research/oscillations-qat.'
