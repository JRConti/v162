title: Disentangling Disease-related Representation from Obscure for Disease Prediction
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Disease-related representations play a crucial role in image-based disease
  prediction such as cancer diagnosis, due to its considerable generalization capacity.
  However, it is still a challenge to identify lesion characteristics in obscured
  images, as many lesions are obscured by other tissues. In this paper, to learn the
  representations for identifying obscured lesions, we propose a disentanglement learning
  strategy under the guidance of alpha blending generation in an encoder-decoder framework
  (DAB-Net). Specifically, we take mammogram mass benign/malignant classification
  as an example. In our framework, composite obscured mass images are generated by
  alpha blending and then explicitly disentangled into disease-related mass features
  and interference glands features. To achieve disentanglement learning, features
  of these two parts are decoded to reconstruct the mass and the glands with corresponding
  reconstruction losses, and only disease-related mass features are fed into the classifier
  for disease prediction. Experimental results on one public dataset DDSM and three
  in-house datasets demonstrate that the proposed strategy can achieve state-of-the-art
  performance. DAB-Net achieves substantial improvements of 3.9%~4.4% AUC in obscured
  cases. Besides, the visualization analysis shows the model can better disentangle
  the mass and glands in the obscured image, suggesting the effectiveness of our solution
  in exploring the hidden characteristics in this challenging problem.
