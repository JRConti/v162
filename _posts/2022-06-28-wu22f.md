title: 'MemSR: Training Memory-efficient Lightweight Model for Image Super-Resolution'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Methods based on deep neural networks with a massive number of layers and
  skip-connections have made impressive improvements on single image super-resolution
  (SISR). The skip-connections in these complex models boost the performance at the
  cost of a large amount of memory. With the increase of camera resolution from 1
  million pixels to 100 million pixels on mobile phones, the memory footprint of these
  algorithms also increases hundreds of times, which restricts the applicability of
  these models on memory-limited devices. A plain model consisting of a stack of 3{\texttimes}3
  convolutions with ReLU, in contrast, has the highest memory efficiency but poorly
  performs on super-resolution. This paper aims at calculating a winning initialization
  from a complex teacher network for a plain student network, which can provide performance
  comparable to complex models. To this end, we convert the teacher model to an equivalent
  large plain model and derive the plain student’s initialization. We further improve
  the student’s performance through initialization-aware feature distillation. Extensive
  experiments suggest that the proposed method results in a model with a competitive
  trade-off between accuracy and speed at a much lower memory footprint than other
  state-of-the-art lightweight approaches.
