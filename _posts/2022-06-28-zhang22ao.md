title: 'PLATON: Pruning Large Transformer Models with Upper Confidence Bound of Weight
  Importance'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Large Transformer-based models have exhibited superior performance in various
  natural language processing and computer vision tasks. However, these models contain
  enormous amounts of parameters, which restrict their deployment to real-world applications.
  To reduce the model size, researchers prune these models based on the weightsâ€™ importance
  scores. However, such scores are usually estimated on mini-batches during training,
  which incurs large variability/uncertainty due to mini-batch sampling and complicated
  training dynamics. As a result, some crucial weights could be pruned by commonly
  used pruning methods because of such uncertainty, which makes training unstable
  and hurts generalization. To resolve this issue, we propose PLATON, which captures
  the uncertainty of importance scores by upper confidence bound of importance estimation.
  In particular, for the weights with low importance scores but high uncertainty,
  PLATON tends to retain them and explores their capacity. We conduct extensive experiments
  with several Transformer-based models on natural language understanding, question
  answering and image classification to validate the effectiveness of PLATON. Results
  demonstrate that PLATON manifests notable improvement under different sparsity levels.
