title: 'AdAUC: End-to-end Adversarial AUC Optimization Against Long-tail Problems'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: It is well-known that deep learning models are vulnerable to adversarial
  examples. Existing studies of adversarial training have made great progress against
  this challenge. As a typical trait, they often assume that the class distribution
  is overall balanced. However, long-tail datasets are ubiquitous in a wide spectrum
  of applications, where the amount of head class instances is significantly larger
  than the tail classes. Under such a scenario, AUC is a much more reasonable metric
  than accuracy since it is insensitive toward class distribution. Motivated by this,
  we present an early trial to explore adversarial training methods to optimize AUC.
  The main challenge lies in that the positive and negative examples are tightly coupled
  in the objective function. As a direct result, one cannot generate adversarial examples
  without a full scan of the dataset. To address this issue, based on a concavity
  regularization scheme, we reformulate the AUC optimization problem as a saddle point
  problem, where the objective becomes an instance-wise function. This leads to an
  end-to-end training protocol. Furthermore, we provide a convergence guarantee of
  the proposed training algorithm. Our analysis differs from the existing studies
  since the algorithm is asked to generate adversarial examples by calculating the
  gradient of a min-max problem. Finally, the extensive experimental results show
  the performance and robustness of our algorithm in three long-tail datasets.
