title: 'Head2Toe: Utilizing Intermediate Representations for Better Transfer Learning'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Transfer-learning methods aim to improve performance in a data-scarce target
  domain using a model pretrained on a data-rich source domain. A cost-efficient strategy,
  linear probing, involves freezing the source model and training a new classification
  head for the target domain. This strategy is outperformed by a more costly but state-of-the-art
  method – fine-tuning all parameters of the source model to the target domain – possibly
  because fine-tuning allows the model to leverage useful information from intermediate
  layers which is otherwise discarded by the later previously trained layers. We explore
  the hypothesis that these intermediate layers might be directly exploited. We propose
  a method, Head-to-Toe probing (Head2Toe), that selects features from all layers
  of the source model to train a classification head for the target-domain. In evaluations
  on the Visual Task Adaptation Benchmark-1k, Head2Toe matches performance obtained
  with fine-tuning on average while reducing training and storage cost hundred folds
  or more, but critically, for out-of-distribution transfer, Head2Toe outperforms
  fine-tuning. Code used in our experiments can be found in other_files materials.
