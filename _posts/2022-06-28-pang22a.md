title: Robustness and Accuracy Could Be Reconcilable by (Proper) Definition
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The trade-off between robustness and accuracy has been widely studied in
  the adversarial literature. Although still controversial, the prevailing view is
  that this trade-off is inherent, either empirically or theoretically. Thus, we dig
  for the origin of this trade-off in adversarial training and find that it may stem
  from the improperly defined robust error, which imposes an inductive bias of local
  invariance â€” an overcorrection towards smoothness. Given this, we advocate employing
  local equivariance to describe the ideal behavior of a robust model, leading to
  a self-consistent robust error named SCORE. By definition, SCORE facilitates the
  reconciliation between robustness and accuracy, while still handling the worst-case
  uncertainty via robust optimization. By simply substituting KL divergence with variants
  of distance metrics, SCORE can be efficiently minimized. Empirically, our models
  achieve top-rank performance on RobustBench under AutoAttack. Besides, SCORE provides
  instructive insights for explaining the overfitting phenomenon and semantic input
  gradients observed on robust models.
