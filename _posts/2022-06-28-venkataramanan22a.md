title: Estimation in Rotationally Invariant Generalized Linear Models via Approximate
  Message Passing
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We consider the problem of signal estimation in generalized linear models
  defined via rotationally invariant design matrices. Since these matrices can have
  an arbitrary spectral distribution, this model is well suited for capturing complex
  correlation structures which often arise in applications. We propose a novel family
  of approximate message passing (AMP) algorithms for signal estimation, and rigorously
  characterize their performance in the high-dimensional limit via a state evolution
  recursion. Our rotationally invariant AMP has complexity of the same order as the
  existing AMP derived under the restrictive assumption of a Gaussian design; our
  algorithm also recovers this existing AMP as a special case. Numerical results showcase
  a performance close to Vector AMP (which is conjectured to be Bayes-optimal in some
  settings), but obtained with a much lower complexity, as the proposed algorithm
  does not require a computationally expensive singular value decomposition.
