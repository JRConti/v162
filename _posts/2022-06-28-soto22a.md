title: Lightweight Projective Derivative Codes for Compressed Asynchronous Gradient
  Descent
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Coded distributed computation has become common practice for performing
  gradient descent on large datasets to mitigate stragglers and other faults. This
  paper proposes a novel algorithm that encodes the partial derivatives themselves
  and furthermore optimizes the codes by performing lossy compression on the derivative
  codewords by maximizing the information contained in the codewords while minimizing
  the information between the codewords. The utility of this application of coding
  theory is a geometrical consequence of the observed fact in optimization research
  that noise is tolerable, sometimes even helpful, in gradient descent based learning
  algorithms since it helps avoid overfitting and local minima. This stands in contrast
  with much current conventional work on distributed coded computation which focuses
  on recovering all of the data from the workers. A second further contribution is
  that the low-weight nature of the coding scheme allows for asynchronous gradient
  updates since the code can be iteratively decoded; i.e., a workerâ€™s task can immediately
  be updated into the larger gradient. The directional derivative is always a linear
  function of the direction vectors; thus, our framework is robust since it can apply
  linear coding techniques to general machine learning frameworks such as deep neural
  networks.
