title: Nearly Minimax Optimal Reinforcement Learning with Linear Function Approximation
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We study reinforcement learning with linear function approximation where
  the transition probability and reward functions are linear with respect to a feature
  mapping $\boldsymbol{\phi}(s,a)$. Specifically, we consider the episodic inhomogeneous
  linear Markov Decision Process (MDP), and propose a novel computation-efficient
  algorithm, LSVI-UCB$^+$, which achieves an $\widetilde{O}(Hd\sqrt{T})$ regret bound
  where $H$ is the episode length, $d$ is the feature dimension, and $T$ is the number
  of steps. LSVI-UCB$^+$ builds on weighted ridge regression and upper confidence
  value iteration with a Bernstein-type exploration bonus. Our statistical results
  are obtained with novel analytical tools, including a new Bernstein self-normalized
  bound with conservatism on elliptical potentials, and refined analysis of the correction
  term. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first minimax optimal algorithm
  for linear MDPs up to logarithmic factors, which closes the $\sqrt{Hd}$ gap between
  the best known upper bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{H^3d^3T})$ in \cite{jin2020provably}
  and lower bound of $\Omega(Hd\sqrt{T})$ for linear MDPs.
