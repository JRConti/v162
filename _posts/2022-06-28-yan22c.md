title: Active fairness auditing
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'The fast spreading adoption of machine learning (ML) by companies across
  industries poses significant regulatory challenges. One such challenge is scalability:
  how can regulatory bodies efficiently <em>audit</em> these ML models, ensuring that
  they are fair? In this paper, we initiate the study of query-based auditing algorithms
  that can estimate the demographic parity of ML models in a query-efficient manner.
  We propose an optimal deterministic algorithm, as well as a practical randomized,
  oracle-efficient algorithm with comparable guarantees. Furthermore, we make inroads
  into understanding the optimal query complexity of randomized active fairness estimation
  algorithms. Our first exploration of active fairness estimation aims to put AI governance
  on firmer theoretical foundations.'
