title: PDE-Based Optimal Strategy for Unconstrained Online Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Unconstrained Online Linear Optimization (OLO) is a practical problem setting
  to study the training of machine learning models. Existing works proposed a number
  of potential-based algorithms, but in general the design of these potential functions
  relies heavily on guessing. To streamline this workflow, we present a framework
  that generates new potential functions by solving a Partial Differential Equation
  (PDE). Specifically, when losses are 1-Lipschitz, our framework produces a novel
  algorithm with anytime regret bound $C\sqrt{T}+||u||\sqrt{2T}[\sqrt{\log(1+||u||/C)}+2]$,
  where $C$ is a user-specified constant and $u$ is any comparator unknown and unbounded
  a priori. Such a bound attains an optimal loss-regret trade-off without the impractical
  doubling trick. Moreover, a matching lower bound shows that the leading order term,
  including the constant multiplier $\sqrt{2}$, is tight. To our knowledge, the proposed
  algorithm is the first to achieve such optimalities.
