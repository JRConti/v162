title: 'DNA: Domain Generalization with Diversified Neural Averaging'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The inaccessibility of the target domain data causes domain generalization
  (DG) methods prone to forget target discriminative features, and challenges the
  pervasive theme in existing literature in pursuing a single classifier with an ideal
  joint risk. In contrast, this paper investigates model misspecification and attempts
  to bridge DG with classifier ensemble theoretically and methodologically. By introducing
  a pruned Jensen-Shannon (PJS) loss, we show that the target square-root risk w.r.t.
  the PJS loss of the $\rho$-ensemble (the averaged classifier weighted by a quasi-posterior
  $\rho$) is bounded by the averaged source square-root risk of the Gibbs classifiers.
  We derive a tighter bound by enforcing a positive principled diversity measure of
  the classifiers. We give a PAC-Bayes upper bound on the target square-root risk
  of the $\rho$-ensemble. Methodologically, we propose a diversified neural averaging
  (DNA) method for DG, which optimizes the proposed PAC-Bayes bound approximately.
  The DNA method samples Gibbs classifiers transversely and longitudinally by simultaneously
  considering the dropout variational family and optimization trajectory. The $\rho$-ensemble
  is approximated by averaging the longitudinal weights in a single run with dropout
  shut down, ensuring a fast ensemble with low computational overhead. Empirically,
  the proposed DNA method achieves the state-of-the-art classification performance
  on standard DG benchmark datasets.
