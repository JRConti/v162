abstract: The recently developed average-case analysis of optimization methods allows
  a more fine-grained and representative convergence analysis than usual worst-case
  results. In exchange, this analysis requires a more precise hypothesis over the
  data generating process, namely assuming knowledge of the expected spectral distribution
  (ESD) of the random matrix associated with the problem. This work shows that the
  concentration of eigenvalues near the edges of the ESD determines a problem’s asymptotic
  average complexity. This a priori information on this concentration is a more grounded
  assumption than complete knowledge of the ESD. This approximate concentration is
  effectively a middle ground between the coarseness of the worst-case scenario convergence
  and the restrictive previous average-case analysis. We also introduce the Generalized
  Chebyshev method, asymptotically optimal under a hypothesis on this concentration
  and globally optimal when the ESD follows a Beta distribution. We compare its performance
  to classical optimization algorithms, such as gradient descent or Nesterov’s scheme,
  and we show that, in the average-case context, Nesterov’s method is universally
  nearly optimal asymptotically.
