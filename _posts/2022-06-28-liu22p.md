title: 'REvolveR: Continuous Evolutionary Models for Robot-to-robot Policy Transfer'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: A popular paradigm in robotic learning is to train a policy from scratch
  for every new robot. This is not only inefficient but also often impractical for
  complex robots. In this work, we consider the problem of transferring a policy across
  two different robots with significantly different parameters such as kinematics
  and morphology. Existing approaches that train a new policy by matching the action
  or state transition distribution, including imitation learning methods, fail due
  to optimal action and/or state distribution being mismatched in different robots.
  In this paper, we propose a novel method named REvolveR of using continuous evolutionary
  models for robotic policy transfer implemented in a physics simulator. We interpolate
  between the source robot and the target robot by finding a continuous evolutionary
  change of robot parameters. An expert policy on the source robot is transferred
  through training on a sequence of intermediate robots that gradually evolve into
  the target robot. Experiments on a physics simulator show that the proposed continuous
  evolutionary model can effectively transfer the policy across robots and achieve
  superior sample efficiency on new robots. The proposed method is especially advantageous
  in sparse reward settings where exploration can be significantly reduced.
