title: 'UAST: Uncertainty-Aware Siamese Tracking'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Visual object tracking is basically formulated as target classification
  and bounding box estimation. Recent anchor-free Siamese trackers rely on predicting
  the distances to four sides for efficient regression but fail to estimate accurate
  bounding box in complex scenes. We argue that these approaches lack a clear probabilistic
  explanation, so it is desirable to model the uncertainty and ambiguity representation
  of target estimation. To address this issue, this paper presents an Uncertainty-Aware
  Siamese Tracker (UAST) by developing a novel distribution-based regression formulation
  with localization uncertainty. We exploit regression vectors to directly represent
  the discretized probability distribution for four offsets of boxes, which is general,
  flexible and informative. Based on the resulting distributed representation, our
  method is able to provide a probabilistic value of uncertainty. Furthermore, considering
  the high correlation between the uncertainty and regression accuracy, we propose
  to learn a joint representation head of classification and localization quality
  for reliable tracking, which also avoids the inconsistency of classification and
  quality estimation between training and inference. Extensive experiments on several
  challenging tracking benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of UAST and its superiority
  over other Siamese trackers.
