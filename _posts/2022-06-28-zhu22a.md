title: Detecting Corrupted Labels Without Training a Model to Predict
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Label noise in real-world datasets encodes wrong correlation patterns and
  impairs the generalization of deep neural networks (DNNs). It is critical to find
  efficient ways to detect corrupted patterns. Current methods primarily focus on
  designing robust training techniques to prevent DNNs from memorizing corrupted patterns.
  These approaches often require customized training processes and may overfit corrupted
  patterns, leading to a performance drop in detection. In this paper, from a more
  data-centric perspective, we propose a training-free solution to detect corrupted
  labels. Intuitively, “closer” instances are more likely to share the same clean
  label. Based on the neighborhood information, we propose two methods: the first
  one uses “local voting" via checking the noisy label consensuses of nearby features.
  The second one is a ranking-based approach that scores each instance and filters
  out a guaranteed number of instances that are likely to be corrupted. We theoretically
  analyze how the quality of features affects the local voting and provide guidelines
  for tuning neighborhood size. We also prove the worst-case error bound for the ranking-based
  method. Experiments with both synthetic and real-world label noise demonstrate our
  training-free solutions consistently and significantly improve most of the training-based
  baselines. Code is available at github.com/UCSC-REAL/SimiFeat.'
