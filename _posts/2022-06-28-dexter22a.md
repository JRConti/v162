title: On the Convergence of Inexact Predictor-Corrector Methods for Linear Programming
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Interior point methods (IPMs) are a common approach for solving linear
  programs (LPs) with strong theoretical guarantees and solid empirical performance.
  The time complexity of these methods is dominated by the cost of solving a linear
  system of equations at each iteration. In common applications of linear programming,
  particularly in machine learning and scientific computing, the size of this linear
  system can become prohibitively large, requiring the use of iterative solvers, which
  provide an approximate solution to the linear system. However, approximately solving
  the linear system at each iteration of an IPM invalidates the theoretical guarantees
  of common IPM analyses. To remedy this, we theoretically and empirically analyze
  (slightly modified) predictor-corrector IPMs when using approximate linear solvers:
  our approach guarantees that, when certain conditions are satisfied, the number
  of IPM iterations does not increase and that the final solution remains feasible.
  We also provide practical instantiations of approximate linear solvers that satisfy
  these conditions for special classes of constraint matrices using randomized linear
  algebra.'
