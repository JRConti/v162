title: Adversarially Trained Actor Critic for Offline Reinforcement Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'We propose Adversarially Trained Actor Critic (ATAC), a new model-free
  algorithm for offline reinforcement learning (RL) under insufficient data coverage,
  based on the concept of relative pessimism. ATAC is designed as a two-player Stackelberg
  game framing of offline RL: A policy actor competes against an adversarially trained
  value critic, who finds data-consistent scenarios where the actor is inferior to
  the data-collection behavior policy. We prove that, when the actor attains no regret
  in the two-player game, running ATAC produces a policy that provably 1) outperforms
  the behavior policy over a wide range of hyperparameters that control the degree
  of pessimism, and 2) competes with the best policy covered by data with appropriately
  chosen hyperparameters. Compared with existing works, notably our framework offers
  both theoretical guarantees for general function approximation and a deep RL implementation
  scalable to complex environments and large datasets. In the D4RL benchmark, ATAC
  consistently outperforms state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms on a range of continuous
  control tasks.'
