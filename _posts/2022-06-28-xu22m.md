title: Adversarial Attack and Defense for Non-Parametric Two-Sample Tests
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Non-parametric two-sample tests (TSTs) that judge whether two sets of samples
  are drawn from the same distribution, have been widely used in the analysis of critical
  data. People tend to employ TSTs as trusted basic tools and rarely have any doubt
  about their reliability. This paper systematically uncovers the failure mode of
  non-parametric TSTs through adversarial attacks and then proposes corresponding
  defense strategies. First, we theoretically show that an adversary can upper-bound
  the distributional shift which guarantees the attack’s invisibility. Furthermore,
  we theoretically find that the adversary can also degrade the lower bound of a TST’s
  test power, which enables us to iteratively minimize the test criterion in order
  to search for adversarial pairs. To enable TST-agnostic attacks, we propose an ensemble
  attack (EA) framework that jointly minimizes the different types of test criteria.
  Second, to robustify TSTs, we propose a max-min optimization that iteratively generates
  adversarial pairs to train the deep kernels. Extensive experiments on both simulated
  and real-world datasets validate the adversarial vulnerabilities of non-parametric
  TSTs and the effectiveness of our proposed defense. Source code is available at
