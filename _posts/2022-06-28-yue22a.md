title: Neural Tangent Kernel Empowered Federated Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving paradigm where multiple
  participants jointly solve a machine learning problem without sharing raw data.
  Unlike traditional distributed learning, a unique characteristic of FL is statistical
  heterogeneity, namely, data distributions across participants are different from
  each other. Meanwhile, recent advances in the interpretation of neural networks
  have seen a wide use of neural tangent kernels (NTKs) for convergence analyses.
  In this paper, we propose a novel FL paradigm empowered by the NTK framework. The
  paradigm addresses the challenge of statistical heterogeneity by transmitting update
  data that are more expressive than those of the conventional FL paradigms. Specifically,
  sample-wise Jacobian matrices, rather than model weights/gradients, are uploaded
  by participants. The server then constructs an empirical kernel matrix to update
  a global model without explicitly performing gradient descent. We further develop
  a variant with improved communication efficiency and enhanced privacy. Numerical
  results show that the proposed paradigm can achieve the same accuracy while reducing
  the number of communication rounds by an order of magnitude compared to federated
  averaging.
