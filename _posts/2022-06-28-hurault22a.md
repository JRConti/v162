title: Proximal Denoiser for Convergent Plug-and-Play Optimization with Nonconvex
  Regularization
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Plug-and-Play (PnP) methods solve ill-posed inverse problems through iterative
  proximal algorithms by replacing a proximal operator by a denoising operation. When
  applied with deep neural network denoisers, these methods have shown state-of-the-art
  visual performance for image restoration problems. However, their theoretical convergence
  analysis is still incomplete. Most of the existing convergence results consider
  nonexpansive denoisers, which is non-realistic, or limit their analysis to strongly
  convex data-fidelity terms in the inverse problem to solve. Recently, it was proposed
  to train the denoiser as a gradient descent step on a functional parameterized by
  a deep neural network. Using such a denoiser guarantees the convergence of the PnP
  version of the Half-Quadratic-Splitting (PnP-HQS) iterative algorithm. In this paper,
  we show that this gradient denoiser can actually correspond to the proximal operator
  of another scalar function. Given this new result, we exploit the convergence theory
  of proximal algorithms in the nonconvex setting to obtain convergence results for
  PnP-PGD (Proximal Gradient Descent) and PnP-ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of
  Multipliers). When built on top of a smooth gradient denoiser, we show that PnP-PGD
  and PnP-ADMM are convergent and target stationary points of an explicit functional.
  These convergence results are confirmed with numerical experiments on deblurring,
  super-resolution and inpainting.
