title: Prompting Decision Transformer for Few-Shot Policy Generalization
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Human can leverage prior experience and learn novel tasks from a handful
  of demonstrations. In contrast to offline meta-reinforcement learning, which aims
  to achieve quick adaptation through better algorithm design, we investigate the
  effect of architecture inductive bias on the few-shot learning capability. We propose
  a Prompt-based Decision Transformer (Prompt-DT), which leverages the sequential
  modeling ability of the Transformer architecture and the prompt framework to achieve
  few-shot adaptation in offline RL. We design the trajectory prompt, which contains
  segments of the few-shot demonstrations, and encodes task-specific information to
  guide policy generation. Our experiments in five MuJoCo control benchmarks show
  that Prompt-DT is a strong few-shot learner without any extra finetuning on unseen
  target tasks. Prompt-DT outperforms its variants and strong meta offline RL baselines
  by a large margin with a trajectory prompt containing only a few timesteps. Prompt-DT
  is also robust to prompt length changes and can generalize to out-of-distribution
  (OOD) environments. Project page: \href{https://mxu34.github.io/PromptDT/}{https://mxu34.github.io/PromptDT/}.'
