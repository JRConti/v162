title: Characterizing and Overcoming the Greedy Nature of Learning in Multi-modal
  Deep Neural Networks
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'We hypothesize that due to the greedy nature of learning in multi-modal
  deep neural networks, these models tend to rely on just one modality while under-fitting
  the other modalities. Such behavior is counter-intuitive and hurts the models’ generalization,
  as we observe empirically. To estimate the model’s dependence on each modality,
  we compute the gain on the accuracy when the model has access to it in addition
  to another modality. We refer to this gain as the conditional utilization rate.
  In the experiments, we consistently observe an imbalance in conditional utilization
  rates between modalities, across multiple tasks and architectures. Since conditional
  utilization rate cannot be computed efficiently during training, we introduce a
  proxy for it based on the pace at which the model learns from each modality, which
  we refer to as the conditional learning speed. We propose an algorithm to balance
  the conditional learning speeds between modalities during training and demonstrate
  that it indeed addresses the issue of greedy learning. The proposed algorithm improves
  the model’s generalization on three datasets: Colored MNIST, ModelNet40, and NVIDIA
  Dynamic Hand Gesture.'
