title: An Intriguing Property of Geophysics Inversion
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Inversion techniques are widely used to reconstruct subsurface physical
  properties (e.g., velocity, conductivity) from surface-based geophysical measurements
  (e.g., seismic, electric/magnetic (EM) data). The problems are governed by partial
  differential equations (PDEs) like the wave or Maxwellâ€™s equations. Solving geophysical
  inversion problems is challenging due to the ill-posedness and high computational
  cost. To alleviate those issues, recent studies leverage deep neural networks to
  learn the inversion mappings from measurements to the property directly. In this
  paper, we show that such a mapping can be well modeled by a very shallow (but not
  wide) network with only five layers. This is achieved based on our new finding of
  an intriguing property: a near-linear relationship between the input and output,
  after applying integral transform in high dimensional space. In particular, when
  dealing with the inversion from seismic data to subsurface velocity governed by
  a wave equation, the integral results of velocity with Gaussian kernels are linearly
  correlated to the integral of seismic data with sine kernels. Furthermore, this
  property can be easily turned into a light-weight encoder-decoder network for inversion.
  The encoder contains the integration of seismic data and the linear transformation
  without need for fine-tuning. The decoder only consists of a single transformer
  block to reverse the integral of velocity. Experiments show that this interesting
  property holds for two geophysics inversion problems over four different datasets.
  Compared to much deeper InversionNet, our method achieves comparable accuracy, but
  consumes significantly fewer parameters'
