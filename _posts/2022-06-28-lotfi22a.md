title: Bayesian Model Selection, the Marginal Likelihood, and Generalization
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: How do we compare between hypotheses that are entirely consistent with observations?
  The marginal likelihood (aka Bayesian evidence), which represents the probability
  of generating our observations from a prior, provides a distinctive approach to
  this foundational question, automatically encoding Occamâ€™s razor. Although it has
  been observed that the marginal likelihood can overfit and is sensitive to prior
  assumptions, its limitations for hyperparameter learning and discrete model comparison
  have not been thoroughly investigated. We first revisit the appealing properties
  of the marginal likelihood for learning constraints and hypothesis testing. We then
  highlight the conceptual and practical issues in using the marginal likelihood as
  a proxy for generalization. Namely, we show how marginal likelihood can be negatively
  correlated with generalization, with implications for neural architecture search,
  and can lead to both underfitting and overfitting in hyperparameter learning. We
  provide a partial remedy through a conditional marginal likelihood, which we show
  is more aligned with generalization, and practically valuable for large-scale hyperparameter
  learning, such as in deep kernel learning.
