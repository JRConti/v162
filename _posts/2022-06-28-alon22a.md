title: Neuro-Symbolic Language Modeling with Automaton-augmented Retrieval
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Retrieval-based language models (R-LM) model the probability of natural
  language text by combining a standard language model (LM) with examples retrieved
  from an external datastore at test time. While effective, a major bottleneck of
  using these models in practice is the computationally costly datastore search, which
  can be performed as frequently as every time step. In this paper, we present RetoMaton
  - retrieval automaton - which approximates the datastore search, based on (1) saving
  pointers between consecutive datastore entries, and (2) clustering of entries into
  "states". This effectively results in a weighted finite automaton built on top of
  the datastore, instead of representing the datastore as a flat list. The creation
  of the automaton is unsupervised, and a RetoMaton can be constructed from any text
  collection: either the original training corpus or from another domain. Traversing
  this automaton at inference time, in parallel to the LM inference, reduces its perplexity
  by up to 1.85, or alternatively saves up to 83% of the nearest neighbor searches
  over $k$NN-LM (Khandelwal et al., 2020) without hurting perplexity. Our code and
  trained models are available at https://github.com/neulab/retomaton .'
