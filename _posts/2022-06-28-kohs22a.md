title: Markov Chain Monte Carlo for Continuous-Time Switching Dynamical Systems
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Switching dynamical systems are an expressive model class for the analysis
  of time-series data. As in many fields within the natural and engineering sciences,
  the systems under study typically evolve continuously in time, it is natural to
  consider continuous-time model formulations consisting of switching stochastic differential
  equations governed by an underlying Markov jump process. Inference in these types
  of models is however notoriously difficult, and tractable computational schemes
  are rare. In this work, we propose a novel inference algorithm utilizing a Markov
  Chain Monte Carlo approach. The presented Gibbs sampler allows to efficiently obtain
  samples from the exact continuous-time posterior processes. Our framework naturally
  enables Bayesian parameter estimation, and we also include an estimate for the diffusion
  covariance, which is oftentimes assumed fixed in stochastic differential equations
  models. We evaluate our framework under the modeling assumption and compare it against
  an existing variational inference approach.
