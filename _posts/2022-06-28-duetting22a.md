title: Deletion Robust Submodular Maximization over Matroids
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Maximizing a monotone submodular function is a fundamental task in machine
  learning. In this paper we study the deletion robust version of the problem under
  the classic matroids constraint. Here the goal is to extract a small size summary
  of the dataset that contains a high value independent set even after an adversary
  deleted some elements. We present constant-factor approximation algorithms, whose
  space complexity depends on the rank $k$ of the matroid and the number $d$ of deleted
  elements. In the centralized setting we present a $(3.582+O(\varepsilon))$-approximation
  algorithm with summary size $O(k + \frac{d}{\eps^2}\log \frac{k}{\eps})$. In the
  streaming setting we provide a $(5.582+O(\varepsilon))$-approximation algorithm
  with summary size and memory $O(k + \frac{d}{\eps^2}\log \frac{k}{\eps})$. We complement
  our theoretical results with an in-depth experimental analysis showing the effectiveness
  of our algorithms on real-world datasets.
