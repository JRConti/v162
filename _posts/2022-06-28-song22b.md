title: A General Recipe for Likelihood-free Bayesian Optimization
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The acquisition function, a critical component in Bayesian optimization
  (BO), can often be written as the expectation of a utility function under a surrogate
  model. However, to ensure that acquisition functions are tractable to optimize,
  restrictions must be placed on the surrogate model and utility function. To extend
  BO to a broader class of models and utilities, we propose likelihood-free BO (LFBO),
  an approach based on likelihood-free inference. LFBO directly models the acquisition
  function without having to separately perform inference with a probabilistic surrogate
  model. We show that computing the acquisition function in LFBO can be reduced to
  optimizing a weighted classification problem, which extends an existing likelihood-free
  density ratio estimation method related to probability of improvement (PI). By choosing
  the utility function for expected improvement (EI), LFBO outperforms the aforementioned
  method, as well as various state-of-the-art black-box optimization methods on several
  real-world optimization problems. LFBO can also leverage composite structures of
  the objective function, which further improves its regret by several orders of magnitude.
