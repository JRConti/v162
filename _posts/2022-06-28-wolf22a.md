title: A Deep Learning Approach for the Segmentation of Electroencephalography Data
  in Eye Tracking Applications
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The collection of eye gaze information provides a window into many critical
  aspects of human cognition, health and behaviour. Additionally, many neuroscientific
  studies complement the behavioural information gained from eye tracking with the
  high temporal resolution and neurophysiological markers provided by electroencephalography
  (EEG). One of the essential eye-tracking software processing steps is the segmentation
  of the continuous data stream into events relevant to eye-tracking applications,
  such as saccades, fixations, and blinks. Here, we introduce DETRtime, a novel framework
  for time-series segmentation that creates ocular event detectors that do not require
  additionally recorded eye-tracking modality and rely solely on EEG data. Our end-to-end
  deep-learning-based framework brings recent advances in Computer Vision to the forefront
  of the times series segmentation of EEG data. DETRtime achieves state-of-the-art
  performance in ocular event detection across diverse eye-tracking experiment paradigms.
  In addition to that, we provide evidence that our model generalizes well in the
  task of EEG sleep stage segmentation.
