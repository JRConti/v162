title: Does the Data Induce Capacity Control in Deep Learning?
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'We show that the input correlation matrix of typical classification datasets
  has an eigenspectrum where, after a sharp initial drop, a large number of small
  eigenvalues are distributed uniformly over an exponentially large range. This structure
  is mirrored in a network trained on this data: we show that the Hessian and the
  Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) have eigenvalues that are spread uniformly over
  exponentially large ranges. We call such eigenspectra “sloppy” because sets of weights
  corresponding to small eigenvalues can be changed by large magnitudes without affecting
  the loss. Networks trained on atypical datasets with non-sloppy inputs do not share
  these traits and deep networks trained on such datasets generalize poorly. Inspired
  by this, we study the hypothesis that sloppiness of inputs aids generalization in
  deep networks. We show that if the Hessian is sloppy, we can compute non-vacuous
  PAC-Bayes generalization bounds analytically. By exploiting our empirical observation
  that training predominantly takes place in the non-sloppy subspace of the FIM, we
  develop data-distribution dependent PAC-Bayes priors that lead to accurate generalization
  bounds using numerical optimization.'
