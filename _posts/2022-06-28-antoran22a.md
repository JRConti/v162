title: Adapting the Linearised Laplace Model Evidence for Modern Deep Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The linearised Laplace method for estimating model uncertainty has received
  renewed attention in the Bayesian deep learning community. The method provides reliable
  error bars and admits a closed-form expression for the model evidence, allowing
  for scalable selection of model hyperparameters. In this work, we examine the assumptions
  behind this method, particularly in conjunction with model selection. We show that
  these interact poorly with some now-standard tools of deep learning–stochastic approximation
  methods and normalisation layers–and make recommendations for how to better adapt
  this classic method to the modern setting. We provide theoretical support for our
  recommendations and validate them empirically on MLPs, classic CNNs, residual networks
  with and without normalisation layers, generative autoencoders and transformers.
