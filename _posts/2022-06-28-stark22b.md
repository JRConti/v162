title: 'EquiBind: Geometric Deep Learning for Drug Binding Structure Prediction'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Predicting how a drug-like molecule binds to a specific protein target is
  a core problem in drug discovery. An extremely fast computational binding method
  would enable key applications such as fast virtual screening or drug engineering.
  Existing methods are computationally expensive as they rely on heavy candidate sampling
  coupled with scoring, ranking, and fine-tuning steps. We challenge this paradigm
  with EquiBind, an SE(3)-equivariant geometric deep learning model performing direct-shot
  prediction of both i) the receptor binding location (blind docking) and ii) the
  ligand’s bound pose and orientation. EquiBind achieves significant speed-ups and
  better quality compared to traditional and recent baselines. Further, we show extra
  improvements when coupling it with existing fine-tuning techniques at the cost of
  increased running time. Finally, we propose a novel and fast fine-tuning model that
  adjusts torsion angles of a ligand’s rotatable bonds based on closed form global
  minima of the von Mises angular distance to a given input atomic point cloud, avoiding
  previous expensive differential evolution strategies for energy minimization.
