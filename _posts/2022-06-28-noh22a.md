title: Path-Aware and Structure-Preserving Generation of Synthetically Accessible
  Molecules
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Computational chemistry aims to autonomously design specific molecules with
  target functionality. Generative frameworks provide useful tools to learn continuous
  representations of molecules in a latent space. While modelers could optimize chemical
  properties, many generated molecules are not synthesizable. To design synthetically
  accessible molecules that preserve main structural motifs of target molecules, we
  propose a reaction-embedded and structure-conditioned variational autoencoder. As
  the latent space jointly encodes molecular structures and their reaction routes,
  our new sampling method that measures the path-informed structural similarity allows
  us to effectively generate structurally analogous synthesizable molecules. When
  targeting out-of-domain as well as in-domain seed structures, our model generates
  structurally and property-wisely similar molecules equipped with well-defined reaction
  paths. By focusing on the important region in chemical space, we also demonstrate
  that our model can design new molecules with even higher activity than the seed
  molecules.
