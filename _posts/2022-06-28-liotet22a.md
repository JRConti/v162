title: Delayed Reinforcement Learning by Imitation
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: When the agentâ€™s observations or interactions are delayed, classic reinforcement
  learning tools usually fail. In this paper, we propose a simple yet new and efficient
  solution to this problem. We assume that, in the undelayed environment, an efficient
  policy is known or can be easily learnt, but the task may suffer from delays in
  practice and we thus want to take them into account. We present a novel algorithm,
  Delayed Imitation with Dataset Aggregation (DIDA), which builds upon imitation learning
  methods to learn how to act in a delayed environment from undelayed demonstrations.
  We provide a theoretical analysis of the approach that will guide the practical
  design of DIDA. These results are also of general interest in the delayed reinforcement
  learning literature by providing bounds on the performance between delayed and undelayed
  tasks, under smoothness conditions. We show empirically that DIDA obtains high performances
  with a remarkable sample efficiency on a variety of tasks, including robotic locomotion,
  classic control, and trading.
