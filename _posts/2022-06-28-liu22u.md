title: 'Learning from Demonstration: Provably Efficient Adversarial Policy Imitation
  with Linear Function Approximation'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL), the agent aims to learn
  a policy from an expert demonstration so that its performance cannot be discriminated
  from the expert policy on a certain predefined reward set. In this paper, we study
  GAIL in both online and offline settings with linear function approximation, where
  both the transition and reward function are linear in the feature maps. Besides
  the expert demonstration, in the online setting the agent can interact with the
  environment, while in the offline setting the agent only accesses an additional
  dataset collected by a prior. For online GAIL, we propose an optimistic generative
  adversarial policy imitation algorithm (OGAPI) and prove that OGAPI achieves $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{H^4d^3K}+\sqrt{H^3d^2K^2/N_1})$
  regret. Here $N_1$ represents the number of trajectories of the expert demonstration,
  $d$ is the feature dimension, and $K$ is the number of episodes. For offline GAIL,
  we propose a pessimistic generative adversarial policy imitation algorithm (PGAPI).
  We also obtain the optimality gap of PGAPI, achieving the minimax lower bound in
  the utilization of the additional dataset. Assuming sufficient coverage on the additional
  dataset, we show that PGAPI achieves $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{H^4d^2/K}+\sqrt{H^4d^3/N_2}+\sqrt{H^3d^2/N_1})$
  optimality gap. Here $N_2$ represents the number of trajectories of the additional
  dataset with sufficient coverage.
