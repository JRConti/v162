title: Exploring and Exploiting Hubness Priors for High-Quality GAN Latent Sampling
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Despite the extensive studies on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs),
  how to reliably sample high-quality images from their latent spaces remains an under-explored
  topic. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN latent sampling method by exploring
  and exploiting the hubness priors of GAN latent distributions. Our key insight is
  that the high dimensionality of the GAN latent space will inevitably lead to the
  emergence of hub latents that usually have much larger sampling densities than other
  latents in the latent space. As a result, these hub latents are better trained and
  thus contribute more to the synthesis of high-quality images. Unlike the a posterior
  "cherry-picking", our method is highly efficient as it is an a priori method that
  identifies high-quality latents before the synthesis of images. Furthermore, we
  show that the well-known but purely empirical truncation trick is a naive approximation
  to the central clustering effect of hub latents, which not only uncovers the rationale
  of the truncation trick, but also indicates the superiority and fundamentality of
  our method. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
  proposed method. Our code is available at: https://github.com/Byronliang8/HubnessGANSampling.'
