title: Supervised Learning with General Risk Functionals
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Standard uniform convergence results bound the generalization gap of the
  expected loss over a hypothesis class. The emergence of risk-sensitive learning
  requires generalization guarantees for functionals of the loss distribution beyond
  the expectation. While prior works specialize in uniform convergence of particular
  functionals, our work provides uniform convergence for a general class of Hölder
  risk functionals for which the closeness in the Cumulative Distribution Function
  (CDF) entails closeness in risk. We establish the first uniform convergence results
  for estimating the CDF of the loss distribution, which yield uniform convergence
  guarantees that hold simultaneously both over a class of Hölder risk functionals
  and over a hypothesis class. Thus licensed to perform empirical risk minimization,
  we develop practical gradient-based methods for minimizing distortion risks (widely
  studied subset of Hölder risks that subsumes the spectral risks, including the mean,
  conditional value at risk, cumulative prospect theory risks, and others) and provide
  convergence guarantees. In experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy of our learning
  procedure, both in settings where uniform convergence results hold and in high-dimensional
  settings with deep networks.
