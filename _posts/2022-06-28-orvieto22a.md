title: Anticorrelated Noise Injection for Improved Generalization
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Injecting artificial noise into gradient descent (GD) is commonly employed
  to improve the performance of machine learning models. Usually, uncorrelated noise
  is used in such perturbed gradient descent (PGD) methods. It is, however, not known
  if this is optimal or whether other types of noise could provide better generalization
  performance. In this paper, we zoom in on the problem of correlating the perturbations
  of consecutive PGD steps. We consider a variety of objective functions for which
  we find that GD with anticorrelated perturbations ("Anti-PGD") generalizes significantly
  better than GD and standard (uncorrelated) PGD. To support these experimental findings,
  we also derive a theoretical analysis that demonstrates that Anti-PGD moves to wider
  minima, while GD and PGD remain stuck in suboptimal regions or even diverge. This
  new connection between anticorrelated noise and generalization opens the field to
  novel ways to exploit noise for training machine learning models.
