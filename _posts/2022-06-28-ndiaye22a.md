title: Stable Conformal Prediction Sets
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: When one observes a sequence of variables $(x_1, y_1), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)$,
  Conformal Prediction (CP) is a methodology that allows to estimate a confidence
  set for $y_{n+1}$ given $x_{n+1}$ by merely assuming that the distribution of the
  data is exchangeable. CP sets have guaranteed coverage for any finite population
  size $n$. While appealing, the computation of such a set turns out to be infeasible
  in general, \eg when the unknown variable $y_{n+1}$ is continuous. The bottleneck
  is that it is based on a procedure that readjusts a prediction model on data where
  we replace the unknown target by all its possible values in order to select the
  most probable one. This requires computing an infinite number of models, which often
  makes it intractable. In this paper, we combine CP techniques with classical algorithmic
  stability bounds to derive a prediction set computable with a single model fit.
  We demonstrate that our proposed confidence set does not lose any coverage guarantees
  while avoiding the need for data splitting as currently done in the literature.
  We provide some numerical experiments to illustrate the tightness of our estimation
  when the sample size is sufficiently large, on both synthetic and real datasets.
