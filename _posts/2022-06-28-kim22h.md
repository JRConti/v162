title: Sanity Simulations for Saliency Methods
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Saliency methods are a popular class of feature attribution explanation
  methods that aim to capture a model’s predictive reasoning by identifying "important"
  pixels in an input image. However, the development and adoption of these methods
  are hindered by the lack of access to ground-truth model reasoning, which prevents
  accurate evaluation. In this work, we design a synthetic benchmarking framework,
  SMERF, that allows us to perform ground-truth-based evaluation while controlling
  the complexity of the model’s reasoning. Experimentally, SMERF reveals significant
  limitations in existing saliency methods and, as a result, represents a useful tool
  for the development of new saliency methods.
