title: Near-Optimal Learning of Extensive-Form Games with Imperfect Information
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'This paper resolves the open question of designing near-optimal algorithms
  for learning imperfect-information extensive-form games from bandit feedback. We
  present the first line of algorithms that require only $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}((XA+YB)/\varepsilon^2)$
  episodes of play to find an $\varepsilon$-approximate Nash equilibrium in two-player
  zero-sum games, where $X,Y$ are the number of information sets and $A,B$ are the
  number of actions for the two players. This improves upon the best known sample
  complexity of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}((X^2A+Y^2B)/\varepsilon^2)$ by a factor of
  $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\max\{X, Y\})$, and matches the information-theoretic lower
  bound up to logarithmic factors. We achieve this sample complexity by two new algorithms:
  Balanced Online Mirror Descent, and Balanced Counterfactual Regret Minimization.
  Both algorithms rely on novel approaches of integrating <em>balanced exploration
  policies</em> into their classical counterparts. We also extend our results to learning
  Coarse Correlated Equilibria in multi-player general-sum games.'
