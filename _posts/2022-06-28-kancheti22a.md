title: Matching Learned Causal Effects of Neural Networks with Domain Priors
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: A trained neural network can be interpreted as a structural causal model
  (SCM) that provides the effect of changing input variables on the modelâ€™s output.
  However, if training data contains both causal and correlational relationships,
  a model that optimizes prediction accuracy may not necessarily learn the true causal
  relationships between input and output variables. On the other hand, expert users
  often have prior knowledge of the causal relationship between certain input variables
  and output from domain knowledge. Therefore, we propose a regularization method
  that aligns the learned causal effects of a neural network with domain priors, including
  both direct and total causal effects. We show that this approach can generalize
  to different kinds of domain priors, including monotonicity of causal effect of
  an input variable on output or zero causal effect of a variable on output for purposes
  of fairness. Our experiments on twelve benchmark datasets show its utility in regularizing
  a neural network model to maintain desired causal effects, without compromising
  on accuracy. Importantly, we also show that a model thus trained is robust and gets
  improved accuracy on noisy inputs.
