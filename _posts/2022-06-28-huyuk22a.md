title: 'Inverse Contextual Bandits: Learning How Behavior Evolves over Time'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Understanding a decision-maker’s priorities by observing their behavior
  is critical for transparency and accountability in decision processes{—}such as
  in healthcare. Though conventional approaches to policy learning almost invariably
  assume stationarity in behavior, this is hardly true in practice: Medical practice
  is constantly evolving as clinical professionals fine-tune their knowledge over
  time. For instance, as the medical community’s understanding of organ transplantations
  has progressed over the years, a pertinent question is: How have actual organ allocation
  policies been evolving? To give an answer, we desire a policy learning method that
  provides interpretable representations of decision-making, in particular capturing
  an agent’s non-stationary knowledge of the world, as well as operating in an offline
  manner. First, we model the evolving behavior of decision-makers in terms of contextual
  bandits, and formalize the problem of Inverse Contextual Bandits ("ICB"). Second,
  we propose two concrete algorithms as solutions, learning parametric and non-parametric
  representations of an agent’s behavior. Finally, using both real and simulated data
  for liver transplantations, we illustrate the applicability and explainability of
  our method, as well as benchmarking and validating the accuracy of our algorithms.'
