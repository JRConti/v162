title: The Teaching Dimension of Regularized Kernel Learners
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Teaching dimension (TD) is a fundamental theoretical property for understanding
  machine teaching algorithms. It measures the sample complexity of teaching a target
  hypothesis to a learner. The TD of linear learners has been studied extensively,
  whereas the results of teaching non-linear learners are rare. A recent result investigates
  the TD of polynomial and Gaussian kernel learners. Unfortunately, the theoretical
  bounds therein show that the TD is high when teaching those non-linear learners.
  Inspired by the fact that regularization can reduce the learning complexity in machine
  learning, a natural question is whether the similar fact happens in machine teaching.
  To answer this essential question, this paper proposes a unified theoretical framework
  termed STARKE to analyze the TD of regularized kernel learners. On the basis of
  STARKE, we derive a generic result of any type of kernels. Furthermore, we disclose
  that the TD of regularized linear and regularized polynomial kernel learners can
  be strictly reduced. For regularized Gaussian kernel learners, we reveal that, although
  their TD is infinite, their epsilon-approximate TD can be exponentially reduced
  compared with that of the unregularized learners. The extensive experimental results
  of teaching the optimization-based learners verify the theoretical findings.
