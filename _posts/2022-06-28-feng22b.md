title: Principled Knowledge Extrapolation with GANs
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Human can extrapolate well, generalize daily knowledge into unseen scenarios,
  raise and answer counterfactual questions. To imitate this ability via generative
  models, previous works have extensively studied explicitly encoding Structural Causal
  Models (SCMs) into architectures of generator networks. This methodology, however,
  limits the flexibility of the generator as they must be carefully crafted to follow
  the causal graph, and demands a ground truth SCM with strong ignorability assumption
  as prior, which is a nontrivial assumption in many real scenarios. Thus, many current
  causal GAN methods fail to generate high fidelity counterfactual results as they
  cannot easily leverage state-of-the-art generative models. In this paper, we propose
  to study counterfactual synthesis from a new perspective of knowledge extrapolation,
  where a given knowledge dimension of the data distribution is extrapolated, but
  the remaining knowledge is kept indistinguishable from the original distribution.
  We show that an adversarial game with a closed-form discriminator can be used to
  address the knowledge extrapolation problem, and a novel principal knowledge descent
  method can efficiently estimate the extrapolated distribution through the adversarial
  game. Our method enjoys both elegant theoretical guarantees and superior performance
  in many scenarios.
