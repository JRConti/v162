  play Connect Four'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Characteristic functions (from cooperative game theory) are able to evaluate
  partial inputs and form the basis for attribution methods like Shapley values. These
  attribution methods allow us to measure how important each input component is for
  the function output—one of the goals of explainable AI (XAI). Given a standard classifier
  function, it is unclear how partial input should be realised. Instead, most XAI-methods
  for black-box classifiers like neural networks consider counterfactual inputs that
  generally lie off-manifold, which makes them hard to evaluate and easy to manipulate.
  We propose a setup to directly train characteristic functions in the form of neural
  networks to play simple two-player games. We apply this to the game of Connect Four
  by randomly hiding colour information from our agents during training. This has
  three advantages for comparing XAI-methods: It alleviates the ambiguity about how
  to realise partial input, makes off-manifold evaluation unnecessary and allows us
  to compare the methods by letting them play against each other.'
