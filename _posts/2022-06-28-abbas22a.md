title: PAC-Bayesian Bounds on Rate-Efficient Classifiers
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We derive analytic bounds on the noise invariance of majority vote classifiers
  operating on compressed inputs. Specifically, starting from recent bounds on the
  true risk of majority vote classifiers, we extend the applicability of PAC-Bayesian
  theory to quantify the resilience of majority votes to input noise stemming from
  compression. The derived bounds are intuitive in binary classification settings,
  where they can be measured as expressions of voter differentials and voter pair
  agreement. By combining measures of input distortion with analytic guarantees on
  noise invariance, we prescribe rate-efficient machines to compress inputs without
  affecting subsequent classification. Our validation shows how bounding noise invariance
  can inform the compression stage for any majority vote classifier such that worst-case
  implications of bad input reconstructions are known, and inputs can be compressed
  to the minimum amount of information needed prior to inference.
