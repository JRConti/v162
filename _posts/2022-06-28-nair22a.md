title: Strategic Representation
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Humans have come to rely on machines for reducing excessive information
  to manageable representations. But this reliance can be abused – strategic machines
  might craft representations that manipulate their users. How can a user make good
  choices based on strategic representations? We formalize this as a learning problem,
  and pursue algorithms for decision-making that are robust to manipulation. In our
  main setting of interest, the system represents attributes of an item to the user,
  who then decides whether or not to consume. We model this interaction through the
  lens of strategic classification (Hardt et al. 2016), reversed: the user, who learns,
  plays first; and the system, which responds, plays second. The system must respond
  with representations that reveal ‘nothing but the truth’ but need not reveal the
  entire truth. Thus, the user faces the problem of learning set functions under strategic
  subset selection, which presents distinct algorithmic and statistical challenges.
  Our main result is a learning algorithm that minimizes error despite strategic representations,
  and our theoretical analysis sheds light on the trade-off between learning effort
  and susceptibility to manipulation.'
