title: Wide Neural Networks Forget Less Catastrophically
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: A primary focus area in continual learning research is alleviating the "catastrophic
  forgetting" problem in neural networks by designing new algorithms that are more
  robust to the distribution shifts. While the recent progress in continual learning
  literature is encouraging, our understanding of what properties of neural networks
  contribute to catastrophic forgetting is still limited. To address this, instead
  of focusing on continual learning algorithms, in this work, we focus on the model
  itself and study the impact of "width" of the neural network architecture on catastrophic
  forgetting, and show that width has a surprisingly significant effect on forgetting.
  To explain this effect, we study the learning dynamics of the network from various
  perspectives such as gradient orthogonality, sparsity, and lazy training regime.
  We provide potential explanations that are consistent with the empirical results
  across different architectures and continual learning benchmarks.
