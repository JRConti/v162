title: Streaming Algorithms for Support-Aware Histograms
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Histograms, i.e., piece-wise constant approximations, are a popular tool
  used to represent data distributions. Traditionally, the difference between the
  histogram and the underlying distribution (i.e., the approximation error) is measured
  using the L_p norm, which sums the differences between the two functions over all
  items in the domain. Although useful in many applications, the drawback of this
  error measure is that it treats approximation errors of all items in the same way,
  irrespective of whether the mass of an item is important for the downstream application
  that uses the approximation. As a result, even relatively simple distributions cannot
  be approximated by succinct histograms without incurring large error. In this paper,
  we address this issue by adapting the definition of approximation so that only the
  errors of the items that belong to the support of the distribution are considered.
  Under this definition, we develop efficient 1-pass and 2-pass streaming algorithms
  that compute near-optimal histograms in sub-linear space. We also present lower
  bounds on the space complexity of this problem. Surprisingly, under this notion
  of error, there is an exponential gap in the space complexity of 1-pass and 2-pass
  streaming algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our algorithms on a
  collection of real and synthetic data sets.
