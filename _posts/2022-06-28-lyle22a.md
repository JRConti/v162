title: Learning Dynamics and Generalization in Deep Reinforcement Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Solving a reinforcement learning (RL) problem poses two competing challenges:
  fitting a potentially discontinuous value function, and generalizing well to new
  observations. In this paper, we analyze the learning dynamics of temporal difference
  algorithms to gain novel insight into the tension between these two objectives.
  We show theoretically that temporal difference learning encourages agents to fit
  non-smooth components of the value function early in training, and at the same time
  induces the second-order effect of discouraging generalization. We corroborate these
  findings in deep RL agents trained on a range of environments, finding that neural
  networks trained using temporal difference algorithms on dense reward tasks exhibit
  weaker generalization between states than randomly initialized networks and networks
  trained with policy gradient methods. Finally, we investigate how post-training
  policy distillation may avoid this pitfall, and show that this approach improves
  generalization to novel environments in the ProcGen suite and improves robustness
  to input perturbations.'
