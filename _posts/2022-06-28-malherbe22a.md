title: 'Robustness in Multi-Objective Submodular Optimization: a Quantile Approach'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The optimization of multi-objective submodular systems appears in a wide
  variety of applications. However, there are currently very few techniques which
  are able to provide a robust allocation to such systems. In this work, we propose
  to design and analyse novel algorithms for the robust allocation of submodular systems
  through lens of quantile maximization. We start by observing that identifying an
  exact solution for this problem is computationally intractable. To tackle this issue,
  we propose a proxy for the quantile function using a softmax formulation, and show
  that this proxy is well suited to submodular optimization. Based on this relaxation,
  we propose a novel and simple algorithm called SOFTSAT. Theoretical properties are
  provided for this algorithm as well as novel approximation guarantees. Finally,
  we provide numerical experiments showing the efficiency of our algorithm with regards
  to state-of-the-art methods in a test bed of real-world applications, and show that
  SOFTSAT is particularly robust and well-suited to online scenarios.
