title: Neural Network Poisson Models for Behavioural and Neural Spike Train Data
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: One of the most important and challenging application areas for complex
  machine learning methods is to predict, characterize and model rich, multi-dimensional,
  neural data. Recent advances in neural recording techniques have made it possible
  to monitor the activity of a large number of neurons across different brain regions
  as animals perform behavioural tasks. This poses the critical challenge of establishing
  links between neural activity at a microscopic scale, which might for instance represent
  sensory input, and at a macroscopic scale, which then generates behaviour. Predominant
  modeling methods apply rather disjoint techniques to these scales; by contrast,
  we suggest an end-to-end model which exploits recent developments of flexible, but
  tractable, neural network point-process models to characterize dependencies between
  stimuli, actions, and neural data. We apply this model to a public dataset collected
  using Neuropixel probes in mice performing a visually-guided behavioural task as
  well as a synthetic dataset produced from a hierarchical network model with reciprocally
  connected sensory and integration circuits intended to characterize animal behaviour
  in a fixed-duration motion discrimination task. We show that our model outperforms
  previous approaches and contributes novel insights into the relationships between
  neural activity and behaviour.
