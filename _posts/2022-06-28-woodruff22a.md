title: Leverage Score Sampling for Tensor Product Matrices in Input Sparsity Time
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We propose an input sparsity time sampling algorithm that can spectrally
  approximate the Gram matrix corresponding to the q-fold column-wise tensor product
  of q matrices using a nearly optimal number of samples, improving upon all previously
  known methods by poly(q) factors. Furthermore, for the important special case of
  the q-fold self-tensoring of a dataset, which is the feature matrix of the degree-q
  polynomial kernel, the leading term of our methodâ€™s runtime is proportional to the
  size of the dataset and has no dependence on q. Previous techniques either incur
  a poly(q) factor slowdown in their runtime or remove the dependence on q at the
  expense of having sub-optimal target dimension, and depend quadratically on the
  number of data-points in their runtime. Our sampling technique relies on a collection
  of q partially correlated random projections which can be simultaneously applied
  to a dataset X in total time that only depends on the size of X, and at the same
  time their q-fold Kronecker product acts as a near-isometry for any fixed vector
  in the column span of $X^{\otimes q}$. We also show that our sampling methods generalize
  to other classes of kernels beyond polynomial, such as Gaussian and Neural Tangent
  kernels.
