title: Improve Single-Point Zeroth-Order Optimization Using High-Pass and Low-Pass
  Filters
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Single-point zeroth-order optimization (SZO) is useful in solving online
  black-box optimization and control problems in time-varying environments, as it
  queries the function value only once at each time step. However, the vanilla SZO
  method is known to suffer from a large estimation variance and slow convergence,
  which seriously limits its practical application. In this work, we borrow the idea
  of high-pass and low-pass filters from extremum seeking control (continuous-time
  version of SZO) and develop a novel SZO method called HLF-SZO by integrating these
  filters. It turns out that the high-pass filter coincides with the residual feedback
  method, and the low-pass filter can be interpreted as the momentum method. As a
  result, the proposed HLF-SZO achieves a much smaller variance and much faster convergence
  than the vanilla SZO method, and empirically outperforms the residual-feedback SZO
  method, which are verified via extensive numerical experiments.
