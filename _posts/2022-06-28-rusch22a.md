title: Graph-Coupled Oscillator Networks
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We propose Graph-Coupled Oscillator Networks (GraphCON), a novel framework
  for deep learning on graphs. It is based on discretizations of a second-order system
  of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which model a network of nonlinear controlled
  and damped oscillators, coupled via the adjacency structure of the underlying graph.
  The flexibility of our framework permits any basic GNN layer (e.g. convolutional
  or attentional) as the coupling function, from which a multi-layer deep neural network
  is built up via the dynamics of the proposed ODEs. We relate the oversmoothing problem,
  commonly encountered in GNNs, to the stability of steady states of the underlying
  ODE and show that zero-Dirichlet energy steady states are not stable for our proposed
  ODEs. This demonstrates that the proposed framework mitigates the oversmoothing
  problem. Moreover, we prove that GraphCON mitigates the exploding and vanishing
  gradients problem to facilitate training of deep multi-layer GNNs. Finally, we show
  that our approach offers competitive performance with respect to the state-of-the-art
  on a variety of graph-based learning tasks.
