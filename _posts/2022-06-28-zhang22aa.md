booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We present BRIEE, an algorithm for efficient reinforcement learning in Markov
  Decision Processes with block-structured dynamics (i.e., Block MDPs), where rich
  observations are generated from a set of unknown latent states. BRIEE interleaves
  latent states discovery, exploration, and exploitation together, and can provably
  learn a near-optimal policy with sample complexity scaling polynomially in the number
  of latent states, actions, and the time horizon, with no dependence on the size
  of the potentially infinite observation space. Empirically, we show that BRIEE is
  more sample efficient than the state-of-art Block MDP algorithm HOMER and other
  empirical RL baselines on challenging rich-observation combination lock problems
  which require deep exploration.
