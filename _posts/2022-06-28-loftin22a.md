title: On the Impossibility of Learning to Cooperate with Adaptive Partner Strategies
  in Repeated Games
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Learning to cooperate with other agents is challenging when those agents
  also possess the ability to adapt to our own behavior. Practical and theoretical
  approaches to learning in cooperative settings typically assume that other agents’
  behaviors are stationary, or else make very specific assumptions about other agents’
  learning processes. The goal of this work is to understand whether we can reliably
  learn to cooperate with other agents without such restrictive assumptions, which
  are unlikely to hold in real-world applications. Our main contribution is a set
  of impossibility results, which show that no learning algorithm can reliably learn
  to cooperate with all possible adaptive partners in a repeated matrix game, even
  if that partner is guaranteed to cooperate with some stationary strategy. Motivated
  by these results, we then discuss potential alternative assumptions which capture
  the idea that an adaptive partner will only adapt rationally to our behavior.
