title: Predicting Out-of-Distribution Error with the Projection Norm
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We propose a metric—<em>Projection Norm</em>—to predict a model’s performance
  on out-of-distribution (OOD) data without access to ground truth labels. Projection
  Norm first uses model predictions to pseudo-label test samples and then trains a
  new model on the pseudo-labels. The more the new model’s parameters differ from
  an in-distribution model, the greater the predicted OOD error. Empirically, our
  approach outperforms existing methods on both image and text classification tasks
  and across different network architectures. Theoretically, we connect our approach
  to a bound on the test error for overparameterized linear models. Furthermore, we
  find that Projection Norm is the only approach that achieves non-trivial detection
  performance on adversarial examples. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/yaodongyu/ProjNorm}.
