title: Modeling Strong and Human-Like Gameplay with KL-Regularized Search
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We consider the task of accurately modeling strong human policies in multi-agent
  decision-making problems, given examples of human behavior. Imitation learning is
  effective at predicting human actions but may not match the strength of expert humans
  (e.g., by sometimes committing blunders), while self-play learning and search techniques
  such as AlphaZero lead to strong performance but may produce policies that differ
  markedly from human behavior. In chess and Go, we show that regularized search algorithms
  that penalize KL divergence from an imitation-learned policy yield higher prediction
  accuracy of strong humans and better performance than imitation learning alone.
  We then introduce a novel regret minimization algorithm that is regularized based
  on the KL divergence from an imitation-learned policy, and show that using this
  algorithm for search in no-press Diplomacy yields a policy that matches the human
  prediction accuracy of imitation learning while being substantially stronger.
