title: Decentralized Online Convex Optimization in Networked Systems
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'We study the problem of networked online convex optimization, where each
  agent individually decides on an action at every time step and agents cooperatively
  seek to minimize the total global cost over a finite horizon. The global cost is
  made up of three types of local costs: convex node costs, temporal interaction costs,
  and spatial interaction costs. In deciding their individual action at each time,
  an agent has access to predictions of local cost functions for the next $k$ time
  steps in an $r$-hop neighborhood. Our work proposes a novel online algorithm, Localized
  Predictive Control (LPC), which generalizes predictive control to multi-agent systems.
  We show that LPC achieves a competitive ratio of $1 + \tilde{O}(\rho_T^k) + \tilde{O}(\rho_S^r)$
  in an adversarial setting, where $\rho_T$ and $\rho_S$ are constants in $(0, 1)$
  that increase with the relative strength of temporal and spatial interaction costs,
  respectively. This is the first competitive ratio bound on decentralized predictive
  control for networked online convex optimization. Further, we show that the dependence
  on $k$ and $r$ in our results is near optimal by lower bounding the competitive
  ratio of any decentralized online algorithm.'
