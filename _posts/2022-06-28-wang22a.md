title: Fast Lossless Neural Compression with Integer-Only Discrete Flows
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: By applying entropy codecs with learned data distributions, neural compressors
  have significantly outperformed traditional codecs in terms of compression ratio.
  However, the high inference latency of neural networks hinders the deployment of
  neural compressors in practical applications. In this work, we propose Integer-only
  Discrete Flows (IODF) an efficient neural compressor with integer-only arithmetic.
  Our work is built upon integer discrete flows, which consists of invertible transformations
  between discrete random variables. We propose efficient invertible transformations
  with integer-only arithmetic based on 8-bit quantization. Our invertible transformation
  is equipped with learnable binary gates to remove redundant filters during inference.
  We deploy IODF with TensorRT on GPUs, achieving $10\times$ inference speedup compared
  to the fastest existing neural compressors, while retaining the high compression
  rates on ImageNet32 and ImageNet64.
