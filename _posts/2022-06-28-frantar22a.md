title: 'SPDY: Accurate Pruning with Speedup Guarantees'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The recent focus on the efficiency of deep neural networks (DNNs) has led
  to significant work on model compression approaches, of which weight pruning is
  one of the most popular. At the same time, there is rapidly-growing computational
  support for efficiently executing the unstructured-sparse models obtained via pruning.
  Yet, most existing pruning methods minimize just the number of remaining weights,
  i.e. the size of the model, rather than optimizing for inference time. We address
  this gap by introducing SPDY, a new compression method which automatically determines
  layer-wise sparsity targets achieving a desired inference speedup on a given system,
  while minimizing accuracy loss. SPDY is the composition of two new techniques. The
  first is an efficient and general dynamic programming algorithm for solving constrained
  layer-wise compression problems, given a set of layer-wise error scores. The second
  technique is a local search procedure for automatically determining such scores
  in an accurate and robust manner. Experiments across popular vision and language
  models show that SPDY guarantees speedups while recovering higher accuracy relative
  to existing strategies, both for one-shot and gradual pruning scenarios, and is
  compatible with most existing pruning approaches. We also extend our approach to
  the recently-proposed task of pruning with very little data, where we achieve the
  best known accuracy recovery when pruning to the GPU-supported 2:4 sparsity pattern.
