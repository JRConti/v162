title: Nearly Optimal Policy Optimization with Stable at Any Time Guarantee
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Policy optimization methods are one of the most widely used classes of Reinforcement
  Learning (RL) algorithms. However, theoretical understanding of these methods remains
  insufficient. Even in the episodic (time-inhomogeneous) tabular setting, the state-of-the-art
  theoretical result of policy-based method in Shani et al. (2020) is only $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{S^2AH^4K})$
  where $S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the number of actions, $H$ is the horizon,
  and $K$ is the number of episodes, and there is a $\sqrt{SH}$ gap compared with
  the information theoretic lower bound $\tilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{SAH^3K})$ (Jin et al.,
  2018). To bridge such a gap, we propose a novel algorithm Reference-based Policy
  Optimization with Stable at Any Time guarantee (RPO-SAT), which features the property
  “Stable at Any Time”. We prove that our algorithm achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{SAH^3K}
  + \sqrt{AH^4K})$ regret. When $S > H$, our algorithm is minimax optimal when ignoring
  logarithmic factors. To our best knowledge, RPO-SAT is the first computationally
  efficient, nearly minimax optimal policy-based algorithm for tabular RL.
