title: A Joint Exponential Mechanism For Differentially Private Top-$k$
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We present a differentially private algorithm for releasing the sequence
  of $k$ elements with the highest counts from a data domain of $d$ elements. The
  algorithm is a "joint" instance of the exponential mechanism, and its output space
  consists of all $O(d^k)$ length-$k$ sequences. Our main contribution is a method
  to sample this exponential mechanism in time $O(dk\log(k) + d\log(d))$ and space
  $O(dk)$. Experiments show that this approach outperforms existing pure differential
  privacy methods and improves upon even approximate differential privacy methods
  for moderate $k$.
