title: Multi-Task Learning as a Bargaining Game
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In Multi-task learning (MTL), a joint model is trained to simultaneously
  make predictions for several tasks. Joint training reduces computation costs and
  improves data efficiency; however, since the gradients of these different tasks
  may conflict, training a joint model for MTL often yields lower performance than
  its corresponding single-task counterparts. A common method for alleviating this
  issue is to combine per-task gradients into a joint update direction using a particular
  heuristic. In this paper, we propose viewing the gradients combination step as a
  bargaining game, where tasks negotiate to reach an agreement on a joint direction
  of parameter update. Under certain assumptions, the bargaining problem has a unique
  solution, known as the <em>Nash Bargaining Solution</em>, which we propose to use
  as a principled approach to multi-task learning. We describe a new MTL optimization
  procedure, Nash-MTL, and derive theoretical guarantees for its convergence. Empirically,
  we show that Nash-MTL achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple MTL benchmarks
  in various domains.
