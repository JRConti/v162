title: 'Influence-Augmented Local Simulators: a Scalable Solution for Fast Deep RL
  in Large Networked Systems'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Learning effective policies for real-world problems is still an open challenge
  for the field of reinforcement learning (RL). The main limitation being the amount
  of data needed and the pace at which that data can be obtained. In this paper, we
  study how to build lightweight simulators of complicated systems that can run sufficiently
  fast for deep RL to be applicable. We focus on domains where agents interact with
  a reduced portion of a larger environment while still being affected by the global
  dynamics. Our method combines the use of local simulators with learned models that
  mimic the influence of the global system. The experiments reveal that incorporating
  this idea into the deep RL workflow can considerably accelerate the training process
  and presents several opportunities for the future.
