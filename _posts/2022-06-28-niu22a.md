title: Efficient Test-Time Model Adaptation without Forgetting
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Test-time adaptation provides an effective means of tackling the potential
  distribution shift between model training and inference, by dynamically updating
  the model at test time. This area has seen fast progress recently, at the effectiveness
  of handling test shifts. Nonetheless, prior methods still suffer two key limitations:
  1) these methods rely on performing backward computation for each test sample, which
  takes a considerable amount of time; and 2) these methods focus on improving the
  performance on out-of-distribution test samples and ignore that the adaptation on
  test data may result in a catastrophic forgetting issue, \ie, the performance on
  in-distribution test samples may degrade. To address these issues, we propose an
  efficient anti-forgetting test-time adaptation (EATA) method. Specifically, we devise
  a sample-efficient entropy minimization loss to exclude uninformative samples out
  of backward computation, which improves the overall efficiency and meanwhile boosts
  the out-of-distribution accuracy. Afterward, we introduce a regularization loss
  to ensure that critical model weights tend to be preserved during adaptation, thereby
  alleviating the forgetting issue. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10-C, ImageNet-C,
  and ImageNet-R verify the effectiveness and superiority of our EATA.'
