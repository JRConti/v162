title: Structure-Aware Transformer for Graph Representation Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The Transformer architecture has gained growing attention in graph representation
  learning recently, as it naturally overcomes several limitations of graph neural
  networks (GNNs) by avoiding their strict structural inductive biases and instead
  only encoding the graph structure via positional encoding. Here, we show that the
  node representations generated by the Transformer with positional encoding do not
  necessarily capture structural similarity between them. To address this issue, we
  propose the Structure-Aware Transformer, a class of simple and flexible graph Transformers
  built upon a new self-attention mechanism. This new self-attention incorporates
  structural information into the original self-attention by extracting a subgraph
  representation rooted at each node before computing the attention. We propose several
  methods for automatically generating the subgraph representation and show theoretically
  that the resulting representations are at least as expressive as the subgraph representations.
  Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on five graph prediction
  benchmarks. Our structure-aware framework can leverage any existing GNN to extract
  the subgraph representation, and we show that it systematically improves performance
  relative to the base GNN model, successfully combining the advantages of GNNs and
  Transformers. Our code is available at https://github.com/BorgwardtLab/SAT.
