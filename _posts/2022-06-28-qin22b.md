title: Graph Neural Architecture Search Under Distribution Shifts
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Graph neural architecture search has shown great potentials for automatically
  designing graph neural network (GNN) architectures for graph classification tasks.
  However, when there is a distribution shift between training and testing graphs,
  the existing approaches fail to deal with the problem of adapting to unknown test
  graph structures since they only search for a fixed architecture for all graphs.
  To solve this problem, we propose a novel GRACES model which is able to generalize
  under distribution shifts through tailoring a customized GNN architecture suitable
  for each graph instance with unknown distribution. Specifically, we design a self-supervised
  disentangled graph encoder to characterize invariant factors hidden in diverse graph
  structures. Then, we propose a prototype-based architecture customization strategy
  to generate the most suitable GNN architecture weights in a continuous space for
  each graph instance. We further propose a customized super-network to share weights
  among different architectures for the sake of efficient training. Extensive experiments
  on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed GRACES model
  can adapt to diverse graph structures and achieve state-of-the-art performance for
  graph classification tasks under distribution shifts.
