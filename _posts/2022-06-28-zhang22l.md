title: Fairness Interventions as (Dis)Incentives for Strategic Manipulation
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Although machine learning (ML) algorithms are widely used to make decisions
  about individuals in various domains, concerns have arisen that (1) these algorithms
  are vulnerable to strategic manipulation and "gaming the algorithm"; and (2) ML
  decisions may exhibit bias against certain social groups. Existing works have largely
  examined these as two separate issues, e.g., by focusing on building ML algorithms
  robust to strategic manipulation, or on training a fair ML algorithm. In this study,
  we set out to understand the impact they each have on the other, and examine how
  to characterize fair policies in the presence of strategic behavior. The strategic
  interaction between a decision maker and individuals (as decision takers) is modeled
  as a two-stage (Stackelberg) game; when designing an algorithm, the former anticipates
  the latter may manipulate their features in order to receive more favorable decisions.
  We analytically characterize the equilibrium strategies of both, and examine how
  the algorithms and their resulting fairness properties are affected when the decision
  maker is strategic (anticipates manipulation), as well as the impact of fairness
  interventions on equilibrium strategies. In particular, we identify conditions under
  which anticipation of strategic behavior may mitigate/exacerbate unfairness, and
  conditions under which fairness interventions can serve as (dis)incentives for strategic
  manipulation.
