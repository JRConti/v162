title: 'Correlation Clustering via Strong Triadic Closure Labeling: Fast Approximation
  Algorithms and Practical Lower Bounds'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Correlation clustering is a widely studied framework for clustering based
  on pairwise similarity and dissimilarity scores, but its best approximation algorithms
  rely on impractical linear programming relaxations. We present faster approximation
  algorithms that avoid these relaxations, for two well-studied special cases: cluster
  editing and cluster deletion. We accomplish this by drawing new connections to edge
  labeling problems related to the principle of strong triadic closure. This leads
  to faster and more practical linear programming algorithms, as well as extremely
  scalable combinatorial techniques, including the first combinatorial approximation
  algorithm for cluster deletion. In practice, our algorithms produce approximate
  solutions that nearly match the best algorithms in quality, while scaling to problems
  that are orders of magnitude larger.'
