title: 'TSPipe: Learn from Teacher Faster with Pipelines'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The teacher-student (TS) framework, training a (student) network by utilizing
  an auxiliary superior (teacher) network, has been adopted as a popular training
  paradigm in many machine learning schemes, since the seminal workâ€”Knowledge distillation
  (KD) for model compression and transfer learning. Many recent self-supervised learning
  (SSL) schemes also adopt the TS framework, where teacher networks are maintained
  as the moving average of student networks, called the momentum networks. This paper
  presents TSPipe, a pipelined approach to accelerate the training process of any
  TS frameworks including KD and SSL. Under the observation that the teacher network
  does not need a backward pass, our main idea is to schedule the computation of the
  teacher and student network separately, and fully utilize the GPU during training
  by interleaving the computations of the two networks and relaxing their dependencies.
  In case the teacher network requires a momentum update, we use delayed parameter
  updates only on the teacher network to attain high model accuracy. Compared to existing
  pipeline parallelism schemes, which sacrifice either training throughput or model
  accuracy, TSPipe provides better performance trade-offs, achieving up to 12.15x
  higher throughput.
