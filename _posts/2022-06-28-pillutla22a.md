title: Federated Learning with Partial Model Personalization
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We consider two federated learning algorithms for training partially personalized
  models, where the shared and personal parameters are updated either simultaneously
  or alternately on the devices. Both algorithms have been proposed in the literature,
  but their convergence properties are not fully understood, especially for the alternating
  variant. We provide convergence analyses of both algorithms in the general nonconvex
  setting with partial participation and delineate the regime where one dominates
  the other. Our experiments on real-world image, text, and speech datasets demonstrate
  that (a) partial personalization can obtain most of the benefits of full model personalization
  with a small fraction of personal parameters, and, (b) the alternating update algorithm
  outperforms the simultaneous update algorithm by a small but consistent margin.
