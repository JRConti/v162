title: 'Kernelized Multiplicative Weights for 0/1-Polyhedral Games: Bridging the Gap
  Between Learning in Extensive-Form and Normal-Form Games'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: While extensive-form games (EFGs) can be converted into normal-form games
  (NFGs), doing so comes at the cost of an exponential blowup of the strategy space.
  So, progress on NFGs and EFGs has historically followed separate tracks, with the
  EFG community often having to catch up with advances (\eg last-iterate convergence
  and predictive regret bounds) from the larger NFG community. In this paper we show
  that the Optimistic Multiplicative Weights Update (OMWU) algorithm—the premier learning
  algorithm for NFGs—can be simulated on the normal-form equivalent of an EFG in linear
  time per iteration in the game tree size using a kernel trick. The resulting algorithm,
  <em>Kernelized OMWU (KOMWU)</em>, applies more broadly to all convex games whose
  strategy space is a polytope with 0/1 integral vertices, as long as the kernel can
  be evaluated efficiently. In the particular case of EFGs, KOMWU closes several standing
  gaps between NFG and EFG learning, by enabling direct, black-box transfer to EFGs
  of desirable properties of learning dynamics that were so far known to be achievable
  only in NFGs. Specifically, KOMWU gives the first algorithm that guarantees at the
  same time last-iterate convergence, lower dependence on the size of the game tree
  than all prior algorithms, and $\tilde{\bigOh}(1)$ regret when followed by all players.
