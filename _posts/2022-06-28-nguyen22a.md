title: A Framework for Learning to Request Rich and Contextually Useful Information
  from Humans
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: When deployed, AI agents will encounter problems that are beyond their autonomous
  problem-solving capabilities. Leveraging human assistance can help agents overcome
  their inherent limitations and robustly cope with unfamiliar situations. We present
  a general interactive framework that enables an agent to request and interpret rich,
  contextually useful information from an assistant that has knowledge about the task
  and the environment. We demonstrate the practicality of our framework on a simulated
  human-assisted navigation problem. Aided with an assistance-requesting policy learned
  by our method, a navigation agent achieves up to a 7{\texttimes} improvement in
  success rate on tasks that take place in previously unseen environments, compared
  to fully autonomous behavior. We show that the agent can take advantage of different
  types of information depending on the context, and analyze the benefits and challenges
  of learning the assistance-requesting policy when the assistant can recursively
  decompose tasks into subtasks.
