title: Scaling Out-of-Distribution Detection for Real-World Settings
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution examples is important for safety-critical
  machine learning applications such as detecting novel biological phenomena and self-driving
  cars. However, existing research mainly focuses on simple small-scale settings.
  To set the stage for more realistic out-of-distribution detection, we depart from
  small-scale settings and explore large-scale multiclass and multi-label settings
  with high-resolution images and thousands of classes. To make future work in real-world
  settings possible, we create new benchmarks for three large-scale settings. To test
  ImageNet multiclass anomaly detectors, we introduce the Species dataset containing
  over 700,000 images and over a thousand anomalous species. We leverage ImageNet-21K
  to evaluate PASCAL VOC and COCO multilabel anomaly detectors. Third, we introduce
  a new benchmark for anomaly segmentation by introducing a segmentation benchmark
  with road anomalies. We conduct extensive experiments in these more realistic settings
  for out-of-distribution detection and find that a surprisingly simple detector based
  on the maximum logit outperforms prior methods in all the large-scale multi-class,
  multi-label, and segmentation tasks, establishing a simple new baseline for future
  work.
