  Embodied Agents'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Can world knowledge learned by large language models (LLMs) be used to act
  in interactive environments? In this paper, we investigate the possibility of grounding
  high-level tasks, expressed in natural language (e.g. “make breakfast”), to a chosen
  set of actionable steps (e.g. “open fridge”). While prior work focused on learning
  from explicit step-by-step examples of how to act, we surprisingly find that if
  pre-trained LMs are large enough and prompted appropriately, they can effectively
  decompose high-level tasks into mid-level plans without any further training. However,
  the plans produced naively by LLMs often cannot map precisely to admissible actions.
  We propose a procedure that conditions on existing demonstrations and semantically
  translates the plans to admissible actions. Our evaluation in the recent VirtualHome
  environment shows that the resulting method substantially improves executability
  over the LLM baseline. The conducted human evaluation reveals a trade-off between
  executability and correctness but shows a promising sign towards extracting actionable
  knowledge from language models.
