title: Mitigating Neural Network Overconfidence with Logit Normalization
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution inputs is critical for the safe deployment
  of machine learning models in the real world. However, neural networks are known
  to suffer from the overconfidence issue, where they produce abnormally high confidence
  for both in- and out-of-distribution inputs. In this work, we show that this issue
  can be mitigated through Logit Normalization (LogitNorm)—a simple fix to the cross-entropy
  loss—by enforcing a constant vector norm on the logits in training. Our method is
  motivated by the analysis that the norm of the logit keeps increasing during training,
  leading to overconfident output. Our key idea behind LogitNorm is thus to decouple
  the influence of output’s norm during network optimization. Trained with LogitNorm,
  neural networks produce highly distinguishable confidence scores between in- and
  out-of-distribution data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of LogitNorm,
  reducing the average FPR95 by up to 42.30% on common benchmarks.
