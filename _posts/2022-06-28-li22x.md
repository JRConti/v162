title: Private Adaptive Optimization with Side information
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Adaptive optimization methods have become the default solvers for many machine
  learning tasks. Unfortunately, the benefits of adaptivity may degrade when training
  with differential privacy, as the noise added to ensure privacy reduces the effectiveness
  of the adaptive preconditioner. To this end, we propose AdaDPS, a general framework
  that uses non-sensitive side information to precondition the gradients, allowing
  the effective use of adaptive methods in private settings. We formally show AdaDPS
  reduces the amount of noise needed to achieve similar privacy guarantees, thereby
  improving optimization performance. Empirically, we leverage simple and readily
  available side information to explore the performance of AdaDPS in practice, comparing
  to strong baselines in both centralized and federated settings. Our results show
  that AdaDPS improves accuracy by 7.7% (absolute) on averageâ€”yielding state-of-the-art
  privacy-utility trade-offs on large-scale text and image benchmarks.
