  and Paging'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Fine-tuning models on edge devices like mobile phones would enable privacy-preserving
  personalization over sensitive data. However, edge training has historically been
  limited to relatively small models with simple architectures because training is
  both memory and energy intensive. We present POET, an algorithm to enable training
  large neural networks on memory-scarce battery-operated edge devices. POET jointly
  optimizes the integrated search search spaces of rematerialization and paging, two
  algorithms to reduce the memory consumption of backpropagation. Given a memory budget
  and a run-time constraint, we formulate a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) for
  energy-optimal training. Our approach enables training significantly larger models
  on embedded devices while reducing energy consumption while not modifying mathematical
  correctness of backpropagation. We demonstrate that it is possible to fine-tune
  both ResNet-18 and BERT within the memory constraints of a Cortex-M class embedded
  device while outperforming current edge training methods in energy efficiency. POET
