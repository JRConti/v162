title: Robust Counterfactual Explanations for Tree-Based Ensembles
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Counterfactual explanations inform ways to achieve a desired outcome from
  a machine learning model. However, such explanations are not robust to certain real-world
  changes in the underlying model (e.g., retraining the model, changing hyperparameters,
  etc.), questioning their reliability in several applications, e.g., credit lending.
  In this work, we propose a novel strategy - that we call RobX - to generate robust
  counterfactuals for tree-based ensembles, e.g., XGBoost. Tree-based ensembles pose
  additional challenges in robust counterfactual generation, e.g., they have a non-smooth
  and non-differentiable objective function, and they can change a lot in the parameter
  space under retraining on very similar data. We first introduce a novel metric -
  that we call Counterfactual Stability - that attempts to quantify how robust a counterfactual
  is going to be to model changes under retraining, and comes with desirable theoretical
  properties. Our proposed strategy RobX works with any counterfactual generation
  method (base method) and searches for robust counterfactuals by iteratively refining
  the counterfactual generated by the base method using our metric Counterfactual
  Stability. We compare the performance of RobX with popular counterfactual generation
  methods (for tree-based ensembles) across benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate
  that our strategy generates counterfactuals that are significantly more robust (nearly
  100% validity after actual model changes) and also realistic (in terms of local
  outlier factor) over existing state-of-the-art methods.
