title: Attentional Meta-learners for Few-shot Polythetic Classification
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Polythetic classifications, based on shared patterns of features that need
  neither be universal nor constant among members of a class, are common in the natural
  world and greatly outnumber monothetic classifications over a set of features. We
  show that threshold meta-learners, such as Prototypical Networks, require an embedding
  dimension that is exponential in the number of task-relevant features to emulate
  these functions. In contrast, attentional classifiers, such as Matching Networks,
  are polythetic by default and able to solve these problems with a linear embedding
  dimension. However, we find that in the presence of task-irrelevant features, inherent
  to meta-learning problems, attentional models are susceptible to misclassification.
  To address this challenge, we propose a self-attention feature-selection mechanism
  that adaptively dilutes non-discriminative features. We demonstrate the effectiveness
  of our approach in meta-learning Boolean functions, and synthetic and real-world
  few-shot learning tasks.
