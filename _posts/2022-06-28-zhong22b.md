  from Offline Datasets'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'We study episodic two-player zero-sum Markov games (MGs) in the offline
  setting, where the goal is to find an approximate Nash equilibrium (NE) policy pair
  based on a dataset collected a priori. When the dataset does not have uniform coverage
  over all policy pairs, finding an approximate NE involves challenges in three aspects:
  (i) distributional shift between the behavior policy and the optimal policy, (ii)
  function approximation to handle large state space, and (iii) minimax optimization
  for equilibrium solving. We propose a pessimism-based algorithm, dubbed as pessimistic
  minimax value iteration (PMVI), which overcomes the distributional shift by constructing
  pessimistic estimates of the value functions for both players and outputs a policy
  pair by solving a correlated coarse equilibrium based on the two value functions.
  Furthermore, we establish a data-dependent upper bound on the suboptimality which
  recovers a sublinear rate without the assumption on uniform coverage of the dataset.
  We also prove an information-theoretical lower bound, which shows our upper bound
  is nearly minimax optimal, which suggests that the data-dependent term is intrinsic.
  Our theoretical results also highlight a notion of “relative uncertainty”, which
  characterizes the necessary and sufficient condition for achieving sample efficiency
  in offline MGs. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first nearly minimax
  optimal result for offline MGs with function approximation.'
