title: Learning-based Optimisation of Particle Accelerators Under Partial Observability
  Without Real-World Training
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In recent work, it has been shown that reinforcement learning (RL) is capable
  of solving a variety of problems at sometimes super-human performance levels. But
  despite continued advances in the field, applying RL to complex real-world control
  and optimisation problems has proven difficult. In this contribution, we demonstrate
  how to successfully apply RL to the optimisation of a highly complex real-world
  machine {–} specifically a linear particle accelerator {–} in an only partially
  observable setting and without requiring training on the real machine. Our method
  outperforms conventional optimisation algorithms in both the achieved result and
  time taken as well as already achieving close to human-level performance. We expect
  that such automation of machine optimisation will push the limits of operability,
  increase machine availability and lead to a paradigm shift in how such machines
  are operated, ultimately facilitating advances in a variety of fields, such as science
  and medicine among many others.
