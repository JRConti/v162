title: Optimistic Linear Support and Successor Features as a Basis for Optimal Policy
  Transfer
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In many real-world applications, reinforcement learning (RL) agents might
  have to solve multiple tasks, each one typically modeled via a reward function.
  If reward functions are expressed linearly, and the agent has previously learned
  a set of policies for different tasks, successor features (SFs) can be exploited
  to combine such policies and identify reasonable solutions for new problems. However,
  the identified solutions are not guaranteed to be optimal. We introduce a novel
  algorithm that addresses this limitation. It allows RL agents to combine existing
  policies and directly identify optimal policies for arbitrary new problems, without
  requiring any further interactions with the environment. We first show (under mild
  assumptions) that the transfer learning problem tackled by SFs is equivalent to
  the problem of learning to optimize multiple objectives in RL. We then introduce
  an SF-based extension of the Optimistic Linear Support algorithm to learn a set
  of policies whose SFs form a convex coverage set. We prove that policies in this
  set can be combined via generalized policy improvement to construct optimal behaviors
  for any new linearly-expressible tasks, without requiring any additional training
  samples. We empirically show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art competing
  algorithms both in discrete and continuous domains under value function approximation.
