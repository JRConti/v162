title: Towards Evaluating Adaptivity of Model-Based Reinforcement Learning Methods
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In recent years, a growing number of deep model-based reinforcement learning
  (RL) methods have been introduced. The interest in deep model-based RL is not surprising,
  given its many potential benefits, such as higher sample efficiency and the potential
  for fast adaption to changes in the environment. However, we demonstrate, using
  an improved version of the recently introduced Local Change Adaptation (LoCA) setup,
  that well-known model-based methods such as PlaNet and DreamerV2 perform poorly
  in their ability to adapt to local environmental changes. Combined with prior work
  that made a similar observation about the other popular model-based method, MuZero,
  a trend appears to emerge, suggesting that current deep model-based methods have
  serious limitations. We dive deeper into the causes of this poor performance, by
  identifying elements that hurt adaptive behavior and linking these to underlying
  techniques frequently used in deep model-based RL. We empirically validate these
  insights in the case of linear function approximation by demonstrating that a modified
  version of linear Dyna achieves effective adaptation to local changes. Furthermore,
  we provide detailed insights into the challenges of building an adaptive nonlinear
  model-based method, by experimenting with a nonlinear version of Dyna.
