title: Mitigating Modality Collapse in Multimodal VAEs via Impartial Optimization
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: A number of variational autoencoders (VAEs) have recently emerged with the
  aim of modeling multimodal data, e.g., to jointly model images and their corresponding
  captions. Still, multimodal VAEs tend to focus solely on a subset of the modalities,
  e.g., by fitting the image while neglecting the caption. We refer to this limitation
  as modality collapse. In this work, we argue that this effect is a consequence of
  conflicting gradients during multimodal VAE training. We show how to detect the
  sub-graphs in the computational graphs where gradients conflict (impartiality blocks),
  as well as how to leverage existing gradient-conflict solutions from multitask learning
  to mitigate modality collapse. That is, to ensure impartial optimization across
  modalities. We apply our training framework to several multimodal VAE models, losses
  and datasets from the literature, and empirically show that our framework significantly
  improves the reconstruction performance, conditional generation, and coherence of
  the latent space across modalities.
