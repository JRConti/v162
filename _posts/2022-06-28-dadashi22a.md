title: Continuous Control with Action Quantization from Demonstrations
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'In this paper, we propose a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework
  for problems with continuous action spaces: Action Quantization from Demonstrations
  (AQuaDem). The proposed approach consists in learning a discretization of continuous
  action spaces from human demonstrations. This discretization returns a set of plausible
  actions (in light of the demonstrations) for each input state, thus capturing the
  priors of the demonstrator and their multimodal behavior. By discretizing the action
  space, any discrete action deep RL technique can be readily applied to the continuous
  control problem. Experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art
  methods such as SAC in the RL setup, and GAIL in the Imitation Learning setup. We
  provide a website with interactive videos: https://google-research.github.io/aquadem/
  and make the code available: https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/aquadem.'
