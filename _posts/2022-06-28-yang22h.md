title: Injecting Logical Constraints into Neural Networks via Straight-Through Estimators
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Injecting discrete logical constraints into neural network learning is one
  of the main challenges in neuro-symbolic AI. We find that a straight-through-estimator,
  a method introduced to train binary neural networks, could effectively be applied
  to incorporate logical constraints into neural network learning. More specifically,
  we design a systematic way to represent discrete logical constraints as a loss function;
  minimizing this loss using gradient descent via a straight-through-estimator updates
  the neural networkâ€™s weights in the direction that the binarized outputs satisfy
  the logical constraints. The experimental results show that by leveraging GPUs and
  batch training, this method scales significantly better than existing neuro-symbolic
  methods that require heavy symbolic computation for computing gradients. Also, we
  demonstrate that our method applies to different types of neural networks, such
  as MLP, CNN, and GNN, making them learn with no or fewer labeled data by learning
  directly from known constraints.
