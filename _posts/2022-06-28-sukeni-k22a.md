title: Intriguing Properties of Input-Dependent Randomized Smoothing
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Randomized smoothing is currently considered the state-of-the-art method
  to obtain certifiably robust classifiers. Despite its remarkable performance, the
  method is associated with various serious problems such as “certified accuracy waterfalls”,
  certification vs. accuracy trade-off, or even fairness issues. Input-dependent smoothing
  approaches have been proposed with intention of overcoming these flaws. However,
  we demonstrate that these methods lack formal guarantees and so the resulting certificates
  are not justified. We show that in general, the input-dependent smoothing suffers
  from the curse of dimensionality, forcing the variance function to have low semi-elasticity.
  On the other hand, we provide a theoretical and practical framework that enables
  the usage of input-dependent smoothing even in the presence of the curse of dimensionality,
  under strict restrictions. We present one concrete design of the smoothing variance
  function and test it on CIFAR10 and MNIST. Our design mitigates some of the problems
  of classical smoothing and is formally underlined, yet further improvement of the
  design is still necessary.
