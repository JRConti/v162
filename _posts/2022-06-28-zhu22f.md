title: On Numerical Integration in Neural Ordinary Differential Equations
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The combination of ordinary differential equations and neural networks,
  i.e., neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODE), has been widely studied
  from various angles. However, deciphering the numerical integration in Neural ODE
  is still an open challenge, as many researches demonstrated that numerical integration
  significantly affects the performance of the model. In this paper, we propose the
  inverse modified differential equations (IMDE) to clarify the influence of numerical
  integration on training Neural ODE models. IMDE is determined by the learning task
  and the employed ODE solver. It is shown that training a Neural ODE model actually
  returns a close approximation of the IMDE, rather than the true ODE. With the help
  of IMDE, we deduce that (i) the discrepancy between the learned model and the true
  ODE is bounded by the sum of discretization error and learning loss; (ii) Neural
  ODE using non-symplectic numerical integration fail to learn conservation laws theoretically.
  Several experiments are performed to numerically verify our theoretical analysis.
