title: Asymptotically-Optimal Gaussian Bandits with Side Observations
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'We study the problem of Gaussian bandits with general side information,
  as first introduced by Wu, Szepesvári, and György. In this setting, the play of
  an arm reveals information about other arms, according to an arbitrary <em>a priori</em>
  known <em>side information</em> matrix: each element of this matrix encodes the
  fidelity of the information that the “row" arm reveals about the “column" arm. In
  the case of Gaussian noise, this model subsumes standard bandits, full-feedback,
  and graph-structured feedback as special cases. In this work, we first construct
  an LP-based asymptotic instance-dependent lower bound on the regret. The LP optimizes
  the cost (regret) required to reliably estimate the suboptimality gap of each arm.
  This LP lower bound motivates our main contribution: the first known asymptotically
  optimal algorithm for this general setting.'
