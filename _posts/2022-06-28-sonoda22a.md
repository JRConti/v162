title: Fully-Connected Network on Noncompact Symmetric Space and Ridgelet Transform
  based on Helgason-Fourier Analysis
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Neural network on Riemannian symmetric space such as hyperbolic space and
  the manifold of symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices is an emerging subject
  of research in geometric deep learning. Based on the well-established framework
  of the Helgason-Fourier transform on the noncompact symmetric space, we present
  a fully-connected network and its associated ridgelet transform on the noncompact
  symmetric space, covering the hyperbolic neural network (HNN) and the SPDNet as
  special cases. The ridgelet transform is an analysis operator of a depth-2 continuous
  network spanned by neurons, namely, it maps an arbitrary given function to the weights
  of a network. Thanks to the coordinate-free reformulation, the role of nonlinear
  activation functions is revealed to be a wavelet function. Moreover, the reconstruction
  formula is applied to present a constructive proof of the universality of finite
  networks on symmetric spaces.
