title: Quantifying and Learning Linear Symmetry-Based Disentanglement
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The definition of Linear Symmetry-Based Disentanglement (LSBD) formalizes
  the notion of linearly disentangled representations, but there is currently no metric
  to quantify LSBD. Such a metric is crucial to evaluate LSBD methods and to compare
  them to previous understandings of disentanglement. We propose D_LSBD, a mathematically
  sound metric to quantify LSBD, and provide a practical implementation for SO(2)
  groups. Furthermore, from this metric we derive LSBD-VAE, a semi-supervised method
  to learn LSBD representations. We demonstrate the utility of our metric by showing
  that (1) common VAE-based disentanglement methods donâ€™t learn LSBD representations,
  (2) LSBD-VAE, as well as other recent methods, can learn LSBD representations needing
  only limited supervision on transformations, and (3) various desirable properties
  expressed by existing disentanglement metrics are also achieved by LSBD representations.
