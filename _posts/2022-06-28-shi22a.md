title: Gradient-Free Method for Heavily Constrained Nonconvex Optimization
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Zeroth-order (ZO) method has been shown to be a powerful method for solving
  the optimization problem where explicit expression of the gradients is difficult
  or infeasible to obtain. Recently, due to the practical value of the constrained
  problems, a lot of ZO Frank-Wolfe or projected ZO methods have been proposed. However,
  in many applications, we may have a very large number of nonconvex white/black-box
  constraints, which makes the existing zeroth-order methods extremely inefficient
  (or even not working) since they need to inquire function value of all the constraints
  and project the solution to the complicated feasible set. In this paper, to solve
  the nonconvex problem with a large number of white/black-box constraints, we proposed
  a doubly stochastic zeroth-order gradient method (DSZOG) with momentum method and
  adaptive step size. Theoretically, we prove DSZOG can converge to the $\epsilon$-stationary
  point of the constrained problem. Experimental results in two applications demonstrate
  the superiority of our method in terms of training time and accuracy compared with
  other ZO methods for the constrained problem.
