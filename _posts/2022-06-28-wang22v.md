title: Improving Task-free Continual Learning by Distributionally Robust Memory Evolution
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Task-free continual learning (CL) aims to learn a non-stationary data stream
  without explicit task definitions and not forget previous knowledge. The widely
  adopted memory replay approach could gradually become less effective for long data
  streams, as the model may memorize the stored examples and overfit the memory buffer.
  Second, existing methods overlook the high uncertainty in the memory data distribution
  since there is a big gap between the memory data distribution and the distribution
  of all the previous data examples. To address these problems, for the first time,
  we propose a principled memory evolution framework to dynamically evolve the memory
  data distribution by making the memory buffer gradually harder to be memorized with
  distributionally robust optimization (DRO). We then derive a family of methods to
  evolve the memory buffer data in the continuous probability measure space with Wasserstein
  gradient flow (WGF). The proposed DRO is w.r.t the worst-case evolved memory data
  distribution, thus guarantees the model performance and learns significantly more
  robust features than existing memory-replay-based methods. Extensive experiments
  on existing benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods for
  alleviating forgetting. As a by-product of the proposed framework, our method is
  more robust to adversarial examples than existing task-free CL methods.
