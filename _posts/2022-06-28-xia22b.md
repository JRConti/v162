title: 'ProGCL: Rethinking Hard Negative Mining in Graph Contrastive Learning'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Contrastive Learning (CL) has emerged as a dominant technique for unsupervised
  representation learning which embeds augmented versions of the anchor close to each
  other (positive samples) and pushes the embeddings of other samples (negatives)
  apart. As revealed in recent studies, CL can benefit from hard negatives (negatives
  that are most similar to the anchor). However, we observe limited benefits when
  we adopt existing hard negative mining techniques of other domains in Graph Contrastive
  Learning (GCL). We perform both experimental and theoretical analysis on this phenomenon
  and find it can be attributed to the message passing of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).
  Unlike CL in other domains, most hard negatives are potentially false negatives
  (negatives that share the same class with the anchor) if they are selected merely
  according to the similarities between anchor and themselves, which will undesirably
  push away the samples of the same class. To remedy this deficiency, we propose an
  effective method, dubbed \textbf{ProGCL}, to estimate the probability of a negative
  being true one, which constitutes a more suitable measure for negativesâ€™ hardness
  together with similarity. Additionally, we devise two schemes (i.e., \textbf{ProGCL-weight}
  and \textbf{ProGCL-mix}) to boost the performance of GCL. Extensive experiments
  demonstrate that ProGCL brings notable and consistent improvements over base GCL
  methods and yields multiple state-of-the-art results on several unsupervised benchmarks
  or even exceeds the performance of supervised ones. Also, ProGCL is readily pluggable
  into various negatives-based GCL methods for performance improvement. We release
  the code at \textcolor{magenta}\url{https://github.com/junxia97/ProGCL}.
