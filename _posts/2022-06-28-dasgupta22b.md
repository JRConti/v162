title: Distinguishing rule and exemplar-based generalization in learning systems
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Machine learning systems often do not share the same inductive biases as
  humans and, as a result, extrapolate or generalize in ways that are inconsistent
  with our expectations. The trade-off between exemplar- and rule-based generalization
  has been studied extensively in cognitive psychology; in this work, we present a
  protocol inspired by these experimental approaches to probe the inductive biases
  that control this trade-off in category-learning systems such as artificial neural
  networks. We isolate two such inductive biases: feature-level bias (differences
  in which features are more readily learned) and exemplar-vs-rule bias (differences
  in how these learned features are used for generalization of category labels). We
  find that standard neural network models are feature-biased and have a propensity
  towards exemplar-based extrapolation; we discuss the implications of these findings
  for machine-learning research on data augmentation, fairness, and systematic generalization.'
