title: Private frequency estimation via projective geometry
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In this work, we propose a new algorithm ProjectiveGeometryResponse (PGR)
  for locally differentially private (LDP) frequency estimation. For universe size
  of k and with n users, our eps-LDP algorithm has communication cost ceil(log_2 k)
  and computation cost O(n + k\exp(eps) log k) for the server to approximately reconstruct
  the frequency histogram, while achieve optimal privacy-utility tradeoff. In many
  practical settings this is a significant improvement over the OÂ (n+k^2) computation
  cost that is achieved by the recent PI-RAPPOR algorithm (Feldman and Talwar; 2021).
  Our empirical evaluation shows a speedup of over 50x over PI-RAPPOR while using
  approximately 75x less memory. In addition, the running time of our algorithm is
  comparable to that of HadamardResponse (Acharya, Sun, and Zhang; 2019) and RecursiveHadamardResponse
  (Chen, Kairouz, and Ozgur; 2020) which have significantly worse reconstruction error.
  The error of our algorithm essentially matches that of the communication- and time-inefficient
  but utility-optimal SubsetSelection (SS) algorithm (Ye and Barg; 2017). Our new
  algorithm is based on using Projective Planes over a finite field to define a small
  collection of sets that are close to being pairwise independent and a dynamic programming
  algorithm for approximate histogram reconstruction for the server.
