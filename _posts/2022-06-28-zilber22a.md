title: 'Inductive Matrix Completion: No Bad Local Minima and a Fast Algorithm'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'The inductive matrix completion (IMC) problem is to recover a low rank
  matrix from few observed entries while incorporating prior knowledge about its row
  and column subspaces. In this work, we make three contributions to the IMC problem:
  (i) we prove that under suitable conditions, the IMC optimization landscape has
  no bad local minima; (ii) we derive a simple scheme with theoretical guarantees
  to estimate the rank of the unknown matrix; and (iii) we propose GNIMC, a simple
  Gauss-Newton based method to solve the IMC problem, analyze its runtime and derive
  for it strong recovery guarantees. The guarantees for GNIMC are sharper in several
  aspects than those available for other methods, including a quadratic convergence
  rate, fewer required observed entries and stability to errors or deviations from
  low-rank. Empirically, given entries observed uniformly at random, GNIMC recovers
  the underlying matrix substantially faster than several competing methods.'
