booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Mini-batch optimal transport (m-OT) has been successfully used in practical
  applications that involve probability measures with a very high number of supports.
  The m-OT solves several smaller optimal transport problems and then returns the
  average of their costs and transportation plans. Despite its scalability advantage,
  the m-OT does not consider the relationship between mini-batches which leads to
  undesirable estimation. Moreover, the m-OT does not approximate a proper metric
  between probability measures since the identity property is not satisfied. To address
  these problems, we propose a novel mini-batch scheme for optimal transport, named
  Batch of Mini-batches Optimal Transport (BoMb-OT), that finds the optimal coupling
  between mini-batches and it can be seen as an approximation to a well-defined distance
  on the space of probability measures. Furthermore, we show that the m-OT is a limit
  of the entropic regularized version of the BoMb-OT when the regularized parameter
  goes to infinity. Finally, we carry out experiments on various applications including
  deep generative models, deep domain adaptation, approximate Bayesian computation,
  color transfer, and gradient flow to show that the BoMb-OT can be widely applied
  and performs well in various applications.
