title: Interventional Contrastive Learning with Meta Semantic Regularizer
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Contrastive learning (CL)-based self-supervised learning models learn visual
  representations in a pairwise manner. Although the prevailing CL model has achieved
  great progress, in this paper, we uncover an ever-overlooked phenomenon: When the
  CL model is trained with full images, the performance tested in full images is better
  than that in foreground areas; when the CL model is trained with foreground areas,
  the performance tested in full images is worse than that in foreground areas. This
  observation reveals that backgrounds in images may interfere with the model learning
  semantic information and their influence has not been fully eliminated. To tackle
  this issue, we build a Structural Causal Model (SCM) to model the background as
  a confounder. We propose a backdoor adjustment-based regularization method, namely
  <em>Interventional Contrastive Learning with Meta Semantic Regularizer</em> (ICL-MSR),
  to perform causal intervention towards the proposed SCM. ICL-MSR can be incorporated
  into any existing CL methods to alleviate background distractions from representation
  learning. Theoretically, we prove that ICL-MSR achieves a tighter error bound. Empirically,
  our experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ICL-MSR is able
  to improve the performances of different state-of-the-art CL methods.'
