title: Role-based Multiplex Network Embedding
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In recent years, multiplex network embedding has received great attention
  from researchers. However, existing multiplex network embedding methods neglect
  structural role information, which can be used to determine the structural similarity
  between nodes. To overcome this shortcoming, this work proposes a simple, effective,
  role-based embedding method for multiplex networks, called RMNE. The RMNE uses the
  structural role information of nodes to preserve the structural similarity between
  nodes in the entire multiplex network. Specifically, a role-modified random walk
  is designed to generate node sequences of each node, which can capture both the
  within-layer neighbors, structural role members, and cross-layer structural role
  members of a node. Additionally, the variant of RMNE extends the existing collaborative
  embedding method by unifying the structural role information into our method to
  obtain the role-based node representations. Finally, the proposed methods were evaluated
  on the network reconstruction, node classification, link prediction, and multi-class
  edge classification tasks. The experimental results on eight public, real-world
  multiplex networks demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art
  baseline methods.
