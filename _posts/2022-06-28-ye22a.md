title: 'Centroid Approximation for Bootstrap: Improving Particle Quality at Inference'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Bootstrap is a principled and powerful frequentist statistical tool for
  uncertainty quantification. Unfortunately, standard bootstrap methods are computationally
  intensive due to the need of drawing a large i.i.d. bootstrap sample to approximate
  the ideal bootstrap distribution; this largely hinders their application in large-scale
  machine learning, especially deep learning problems. In this work, we propose an
  efficient method to explicitly <em>optimize</em> a small set of high quality “centroid”
  points to better approximate the ideal bootstrap distribution. We achieve this by
  minimizing a simple objective function that is asymptotically equivalent to the
  Wasserstein distance to the ideal bootstrap distribution. This allows us to provide
  an accurate estimation of uncertainty with a small number of bootstrap centroids,
  outperforming the naive i.i.d. sampling approach. Empirically, we show that our
  method can boost the performance of bootstrap in a variety of applications.
