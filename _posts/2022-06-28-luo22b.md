title: Disentangled Federated Learning for Tackling Attributes Skew via Invariant
  Aggregation and Diversity Transferring
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Attributes skew hinders the current federated learning (FL) frameworks
  from consistent optimization directions among the clients, which inevitably leads
  to performance reduction and unstable convergence. The core problems lie in that:
  1) Domain-specific attributes, which are non-causal and only locally valid, are
  indeliberately mixed into global aggregation. 2) The one-stage optimizations of
  entangled attributes cannot simultaneously satisfy two conflicting objectives, i.e.,
  generalization and personalization. To cope with these, we proposed disentangled
  federated learning (DFL) to disentangle the domain-specific and cross-invariant
  attributes into two complementary branches, which are trained by the proposed alternating
  local-global optimization independently. Importantly, convergence analysis proves
  that the FL system can be stably converged even if incomplete client models participate
  in the global aggregation, which greatly expands the application scope of FL. Extensive
  experiments verify that DFL facilitates FL with higher performance, better interpretability,
  and faster convergence rate, compared with SOTA FL methods on both manually synthesized
  and realistic attributes skew datasets.'
