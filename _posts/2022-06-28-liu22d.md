title: Boosting Graph Structure Learning with Dummy Nodes
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: With the development of graph kernels and graph representation learning,
  many superior methods have been proposed to handle scalability and oversmoothing
  issues on graph structure learning. However, most of those strategies are designed
  based on practical experience rather than theoretical analysis. In this paper, we
  use a particular dummy node connecting to all existing vertices without affecting
  original vertex and edge properties. We further prove that such the dummy node can
  help build an efficient monomorphic edge-to-vertex transform and an epimorphic inverse
  to recover the original graph back. It also indicates that adding dummy nodes can
  preserve local and global structures for better graph representation learning. We
  extend graph kernels and graph neural networks with dummy nodes and conduct experiments
  on graph classification and subgraph isomorphism matching tasks. Empirical results
  demonstrate that taking graphs with dummy nodes as input significantly boosts graph
  structure learning, and using their edge-to-vertex graphs can also achieve similar
  results. We also discuss the gain of expressive power from the dummy in neural networks.
