title: Efficient Learning of CNNs using Patch Based Features
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Recent work has demonstrated the effectiveness of using patch based representations
  when learning from image data. Here we provide theoretical support for this observation,
  by showing that a simple semi-supervised algorithm that uses patch statistics can
  efficiently learn labels produced by a one-hidden-layer Convolutional Neural Network
  (CNN). Since CNNs are known to be computationally hard to learn in the worst case,
  our analysis holds under some distributional assumptions. We show that these assumptions
  are necessary and sufficient for our results to hold. We verify that the distributional
  assumptions hold on real-world data by experimenting on the CIFAR-10 dataset, and
  find that the analyzed algorithm outperforms a vanilla one-hidden-layer CNN. Finally,
  we demonstrate that by running the algorithm in a layer-by-layer fashion we can
  build a deep model which gives further improvements, hinting that this method provides
  insights about the behavior of deep CNNs.
