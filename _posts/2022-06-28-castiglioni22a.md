title: 'Online Learning with Knapsacks: the Best of Both Worlds'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We study online learning problems in which a decision maker wants to maximize
  their expected reward without violating a finite set of $m$ resource constraints.
  By casting the learning process over a suitably defined space of strategy mixtures,
  we recover strong duality on a Lagrangian relaxation of the underlying optimization
  problem, even for general settings with non-convex reward and resource-consumption
  functions. Then, we provide the first best-of-both-worlds type framework for this
  setting, with no-regret guarantees both under stochastic and adversarial inputs.
  Our framework yields the same regret guarantees of prior work in the stochastic
  case. On the other hand, when budgets grow at least linearly in the time horizon,
  it allows us to provide a constant competitive ratio in the adversarial case, which
  improves over the $O(m \log T)$ competitive ratio of Immorlica et al. [FOCSâ€™19].
  Moreover, our framework allows the decision maker to handle non-convex reward and
  cost functions. We provide two game-theoretic applications of our framework to give
  further evidence of its flexibility.
