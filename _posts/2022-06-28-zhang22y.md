title: 'NAFS: A Simple yet Tough-to-beat Baseline for Graph Representation Learning'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown prominent performance
  in graph representation learning by leveraging knowledge from both graph structure
  and node features. However, most of them have two major limitations. First, GNNs
  can learn higher-order structural information by stacking more layers but can not
  deal with large depth due to the over-smoothing issue. Second, it is not easy to
  apply these methods on large graphs due to the expensive computation cost and high
  memory usage. In this paper, we present node-adaptive feature smoothing (NAFS),
  a simple non-parametric method that constructs node representations without parameter
  learning. NAFS first extracts the features of each node with its neighbors of different
  hops by feature smoothing, and then adaptively combines the smoothed features. Besides,
  the constructed node representation can further be enhanced by the ensemble of smoothed
  features extracted via different smoothing strategies. We conduct experiments on
  four benchmark datasets on two different application scenarios: node clustering
  and link prediction. Remarkably, NAFS with feature ensemble outperforms the state-of-the-art
  GNNs on these tasks and mitigates the aforementioned two limitations of most learning-based
  GNN counterparts.'
