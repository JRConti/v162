title: Blocks Assemble! Learning to Assemble with Large-Scale Structured Reinforcement
  Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Assembly of multi-part physical structures is both a valuable end product
  for autonomous robotics, as well as a valuable diagnostic task for open-ended training
  of embodied intelligent agents. We introduce a naturalistic physics-based environment
  with a set of connectable magnet blocks inspired by children’s toy kits. The objective
  is to assemble blocks into a succession of target blueprints. Despite the simplicity
  of this objective, the compositional nature of building diverse blueprints from
  a set of blocks leads to an explosion of complexity in structures that agents encounter.
  Furthermore, assembly stresses agents’ multi-step planning, physical reasoning,
  and bimanual coordination. We find that the combination of large-scale reinforcement
  learning and graph-based policies – surprisingly without any additional complexity
  – is an effective recipe for training agents that not only generalize to complex
  unseen blueprints in a zero-shot manner, but even operate in a reset-free setting
  without being trained to do so. Through extensive experiments, we highlight the
  importance of large-scale training, structured representations, contributions of
  multi-task vs. single-task learning, as well as the effects of curriculums, and
  discuss qualitative behaviors of trained agents. Our accompanying project webpage
