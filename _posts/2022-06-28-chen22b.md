title: Learning Domain Adaptive Object Detection with Probabilistic Teacher
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Self-training for unsupervised domain adaptive object detection is a challenging
  task, of which the performance depends heavily on the quality of pseudo boxes. Despite
  the promising results, prior works have largely overlooked the uncertainty of pseudo
  boxes during self-training. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective framework,
  termed as Probabilistic Teacher (PT), which aims to capture the uncertainty of unlabeled
  target data from a gradually evolving teacher and guides the learning of a student
  in a mutually beneficial manner. Specifically, we propose to leverage the uncertainty-guided
  consistency training to promote classification adaptation and localization adaptation,
  rather than filtering pseudo boxes via an elaborate confidence threshold. In addition,
  we conduct anchor adaptation in parallel with localization adaptation, since anchor
  can be regarded as a learnable parameter. Together with this framework, we also
  present a novel Entropy Focal Loss (EFL) to further facilitate the uncertainty-guided
  self-training. Equipped with EFL, PT outperforms all previous baselines by a large
  margin and achieve new state-of-the-arts.
