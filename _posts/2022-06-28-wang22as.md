title: Thompson Sampling for (Combinatorial) Pure Exploration
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Existing methods of combinatorial pure exploration mainly focus on the UCB
  approach. To make the algorithm efficient, they usually use the sum of upper confidence
  bounds within arm set $S$ to represent the upper confidence bound of $S$, which
  can be much larger than the tight upper confidence bound of $S$ and leads to a much
  higher complexity than necessary, since the empirical means of different arms in
  $S$ are independent. To deal with this challenge, we explore the idea of Thompson
  Sampling (TS) that uses independent random samples instead of the upper confidence
  bounds, and design the first TS-based algorithm TS-Explore for (combinatorial) pure
  exploration. In TS-Explore, the sum of independent random samples within arm set
  $S$ will not exceed the tight upper confidence bound of $S$ with high probability.
  Hence it solves the above challenge, and achieves a lower complexity upper bound
  than existing efficient UCB-based algorithms in general combinatorial pure exploration.
  As for pure exploration of classic multi-armed bandit, we show that TS-Explore achieves
  an asymptotically optimal complexity upper bound.
