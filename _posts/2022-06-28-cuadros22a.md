title: Self-conditioning Pre-Trained Language Models
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In this paper we aim to investigate the mechanisms that guide text generation
  with pre-trained Transformer-based Language Models (TLMs). Grounded on the Product
  of Experts formulation by Hinton (1999), we describe a generative mechanism that
  exploits expert units which naturally exist in TLMs. Such units are responsible
  for detecting concepts in the input and conditioning text generation on such concepts.
  We describe how to identify expert units and how to activate them during inference
  in order to induce any desired concept in the generated output. We find that the
  activation of a surprisingly small amount of units is sufficient to steer text generation
  (as little as 3 units in a model with 345M parameters). While the objective of this
  work is to learn more about how TLMs work, we show that our method is effective
  for conditioning without fine-tuning or using extra parameters, even on fine-grained
  homograph concepts. Additionally, we show that our method can be used to correct
  gender bias present in the output of TLMs and achieves gender parity for all evaluated
  contexts. We compare our method with FUDGE and PPLM-BoW, and show that our approach
  is able to achieve gender parity at a lower perplexity and better Self-BLEU score.
  The proposed method is accessible to a wide audience thanks to its simplicity and
  minimal compute needs. The findings in this paper are a step forward in understanding
  the generative mechanisms of TLMs.
