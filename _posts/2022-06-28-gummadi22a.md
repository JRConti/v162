title: A Parametric Class of Approximate Gradient Updates for Policy Optimization
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: "Approaches to policy optimization have been motivated from diverse principles,
  based on how the parametric model is interpreted (e.g. value versus policy representation)
  or how the learning objective is formulated, yet they share a common goal of maximizing
  expected return. To better capture the commonalities and identify key differences
  between policy optimization methods, we develop a unified perspective that re-expresses
  the underlying updates in terms of a limited choice of gradient form and scaling
  function. In particular, we identify a parameterized space of approximate gradient
  updates for policy optimization that is highly structured, yet covers both classical
  and recent examples, including PPO. \tAs a result, we obtain novel yet well motivated
  updates that generalize existing algorithms in a way that can deliver benefits both
  in terms of convergence speed and final result quality. An experimental investigation
  demonstrates that the additional degrees of freedom provided in the parameterized
  family of updates can be leveraged to obtain non-trivial improvements both in synthetic
  domains and on popular deep RL benchmarks."
