title: Secure Quantized Training for Deep Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We implement training of neural networks in secure multi-party computation
  (MPC) using quantization commonly used in said setting. We are the first to present
  an MNIST classifier purely trained in MPC that comes within 0.2 percent of the accuracy
  of the same convolutional neural network trained via plaintext computation. More
  concretely, we have trained a network with two convolutional and two dense layers
  to 99.2% accuracy in 3.5 hours (under one hour for 99% accuracy). We have also implemented
  AlexNet for CIFAR-10, which converges in a few hours. We develop novel protocols
  for exponentiation and inverse square root. Finally, we present experiments in a
  range of MPC security models for up to ten parties, both with honest and dishonest
  majority as well as semi-honest and malicious security.
