title: Burst-Dependent Plasticity and Dendritic Amplification Support Target-Based
  Learning and Hierarchical Imitation Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The brain can learn to solve a wide range of tasks with high temporal and
  energetic efficiency. However, most biological models are composed of simple single-compartment
  neurons and cannot achieve the state-of-the-art performances of artificial intelligence.
  We propose a multi-compartment model of pyramidal neuron, in which bursts and dendritic
  input segregation give the possibility to plausibly support a biological target-based
  learning. In target-based learning, the internal solution of a problem (a spatio-temporal
  pattern of bursts in our case) is suggested to the network, bypassing the problems
  of error backpropagation and credit assignment. Finally, we show that this neuronal
  architecture naturally supports the orchestration of “hierarchical imitation learning”,
  enabling the decomposition of challenging long-horizon decision-making tasks into
  simpler subtasks.
