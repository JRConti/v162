title: Model Agnostic Sample Reweighting for Out-of-Distribution Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Distributionally robust optimization (DRO) and invariant risk minimization
  (IRM) are two popular methods proposed to improve out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization
  performance of machine learning models. While effective for small models, it has
  been observed that these methods can be vulnerable to overfitting with large overparameterized
  models. This work proposes a principled method, Model Agnostic samPLe rEweighting
  (MAPLE), to effectively address OOD problem, especially in overparameterized scenarios.
  Our key idea is to find an effective reweighting of the training samples so that
  the standard empirical risk minimization training of a large model on the weighted
  training data leads to superior OOD generalization performance. The overfitting
  issue is addressed by considering a bilevel formulation to search for the sample
  reweighting, in which the generalization complexity depends on the search space
  of sample weights instead of the model size. We present theoretical analysis in
  linear case to prove the insensitivity of MAPLE to model size, and empirically verify
  its superiority in surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.
