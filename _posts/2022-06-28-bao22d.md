title: Estimating the Optimal Covariance with Imperfect Mean in Diffusion Probabilistic
  Models
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) are a class of powerful deep generative
  models (DGMs). Despite their success, the iterative generation process over the
  full timesteps is much less efficient than other DGMs such as GANs. Thus, the generation
  performance on a subset of timesteps is crucial, which is greatly influenced by
  the covariance design in DPMs. In this work, we consider diagonal and full covariances
  to improve the expressive power of DPMs. We derive the optimal result for such covariances,
  and then correct it when the mean of DPMs is imperfect. Both the optimal and the
  corrected ones can be decomposed into terms of conditional expectations over functions
  of noise. Building upon it, we propose to estimate the optimal covariance and its
  correction given imperfect mean by learning these conditional expectations. Our
  method can be applied to DPMs with both discrete and continuous timesteps. We consider
  the diagonal covariance in our implementation for computational efficiency. For
  an efficient practical implementation, we adopt a parameter sharing scheme and a
  two-stage training process. Empirically, our method outperforms a wide variety of
  covariance design on likelihood results, and improves the sample quality especially
  on a small number of timesteps.
