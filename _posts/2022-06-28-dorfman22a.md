title: Adapting to Mixing Time in Stochastic Optimization with Markovian Data
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'We consider stochastic optimization problems where data is drawn from a
  Markov chain. Existing methods for this setting crucially rely on knowing the mixing
  time of the chain, which in real-world applications is usually unknown. We propose
  the first optimization method that does not require the knowledge of the mixing
  time, yet obtains the optimal asymptotic convergence rate when applied to convex
  problems. We further show that our approach can be extended to: (i) finding stationary
  points in non-convex optimization with Markovian data, and (ii) obtaining better
  dependence on the mixing time in temporal difference (TD) learning; in both cases,
  our method is completely oblivious to the mixing time. Our method relies on a novel
  combination of multi-level Monte Carlo (MLMC) gradient estimation together with
  an adaptive learning method.'
