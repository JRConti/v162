title: Provable Domain Generalization via Invariant-Feature Subspace Recovery
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Domain generalization asks for models trained over a set of training environments
  to perform well in unseen test environments. Recently, a series of algorithms such
  as Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) has been proposed for domain generalization.
  However, Rosenfeld et al. (2021) shows that in a simple linear data model, even
  if non-convexity issues are ignored, IRM and its extensions cannot generalize to
  unseen environments with less than $d_s+1$ training environments, where $d_s$ is
  the dimension of the spurious-feature subspace. In this paper, we propose to achieve
  domain generalization with Invariant-feature Subspace Recovery (ISR). Our first
  algorithm, ISR-Mean, can identify the subspace spanned by invariant features from
  the first-order moments of the class-conditional distributions, and achieve provable
  domain generalization with $d_s+1$ training environments under the data model of
  Rosenfeld et al. (2021). Our second algorithm, ISR-Cov, further reduces the required
  number of training environments to $O(1)$ using the information of second-order
  moments. Notably, unlike IRM, our algorithms bypass non-convexity issues and enjoy
  global convergence guarantees. Empirically, our ISRs can obtain superior performance
  compared with IRM on synthetic benchmarks. In addition, on three real-world image
  and text datasets, we show that both ISRs can be used as simple yet effective post-processing
  methods to improve the worst-case accuracy of (pre-)trained models against spurious
  correlations and group shifts.
