title: Learning Augmented Binary Search Trees
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: A treap is a classic randomized binary search tree data structure that is
  easy to implement and supports O(log n) expected time access. However, classic treaps
  do not take advantage of the input distribution or patterns in the input. Given
  recent advances in algorithms with predictions, we propose pairing treaps with machine
  advice to form a learning-augmented treap. We are the first to propose a learning-augmented
  data structure that supports binary search tree operations such as range-query and
  successor functionalities. With the assumption that we have access to advice from
  a frequency estimation oracle, we assign learned priorities to the nodes to better
  improve the treap’s structure. We theoretically analyze the learning-augmented treap’s
  performance under various input distributions and show that under those circumstances,
  our learning-augmented treap has stronger guarantees than classic treaps and other
  classic tree-based data structures. Further, we experimentally evaluate our learned
  treap on synthetic datasets and demonstrate a performance advantage over other search
  tree data structures. We also present experiments on real world datasets with known
  frequency estimation oracles and show improvements as well.
