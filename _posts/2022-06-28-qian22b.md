title: 'ContentVec: An Improved Self-Supervised Speech Representation by Disentangling
  Speakers'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Self-supervised learning in speech involves training a speech representation
  network on a large-scale unannotated speech corpus, and then applying the learned
  representations to downstream tasks. Since the majority of the downstream tasks
  of SSL learning in speech largely focus on the content information in speech, the
  most desirable speech representations should be able to disentangle unwanted variations,
  such as speaker variations, from the content. However, disentangling speakers is
  very challenging, because removing the speaker information could easily result in
  a loss of content as well, and the damage of the latter usually far outweighs the
  benefit of the former. In this paper, we propose a new SSL method that can achieve
  speaker disentanglement without severe loss of content. Our approach is adapted
  from the HuBERT framework, and incorporates disentangling mechanisms to regularize
  both the teacher labels and the learned representations. We evaluate the benefit
  of speaker disentanglement on a set of content-related downstream tasks, and observe
  a consistent and notable performance advantage of our speaker-disentangled representations.
