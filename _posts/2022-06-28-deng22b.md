booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Learning the principal eigenfunctions of an integral operator defined by
  a kernel and a data distribution is at the core of many machine learning problems.
  Traditional nonparametric solutions based on the Nystrom formula suffer from scalability
  issues. Recent work has resorted to a parametric approach, i.e., training neural
  networks to approximate the eigenfunctions. However, the existing method relies
  on an expensive orthogonalization step and is difficult to implement. We show that
  these problems can be fixed by using a new series of objective functions that generalizes
  the EigenGame to function space. We test our method on a variety of supervised and
  unsupervised learning problems and show it provides accurate approximations to the
  eigenfunctions of polynomial, radial basis, neural network Gaussian process, and
  neural tangent kernels. Finally, we demonstrate our method can scale up linearised
  Laplace approximation of deep neural networks to modern image classification datasets
  through approximating the Gauss-Newton matrix. Code is available at https://github.com/thudzj/neuraleigenfunction.
