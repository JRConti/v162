title: 'Translating Robot Skills: Learning Unsupervised Skill Correspondences Across
  Robots'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In this paper, we explore how we can endow robots with the ability to learn
  correspondences between their own skills, and those of morphologically different
  robots in different domains, in an entirely unsupervised manner. We make the insight
  that different morphological robots use similar task strategies to solve similar
  tasks. Based on this insight, we frame learning skill correspondences as a problem
  of matching distributions of sequences of skills across robots. We then present
  an unsupervised objective that encourages a learnt skill translation model to match
  these distributions across domains, inspired by recent advances in unsupervised
  machine translation. Our approach is able to learn semantically meaningful correspondences
  between skills across multiple robot-robot and human-robot domain pairs despite
  being completely unsupervised. Further, the learnt correspondences enable the transfer
  of task strategies across robots and domains. We present dynamic visualizations
