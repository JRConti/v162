title: Utilizing Expert Features for Contrastive Learning of Time-Series Representations
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We present an approach that incorporates expert knowledge for time-series
  representation learning. Our method employs expert features to replace the commonly
  used data transformations in previous contrastive learning approaches. We do this
  since time-series data frequently stems from the industrial or medical field where
  expert features are often available from domain experts, while transformations are
  generally elusive for time-series data. We start by proposing two properties that
  useful time-series representations should fulfill and show that current representation
  learning approaches do not ensure these properties. We therefore devise ExpCLR,
  a novel contrastive learning approach built on an objective that utilizes expert
  features to encourage both properties for the learned representation. Finally, we
  demonstrate on three real-world time-series datasets that ExpCLR surpasses several
  state-of-the-art methods for both unsupervised and semi-supervised representation
  learning.
