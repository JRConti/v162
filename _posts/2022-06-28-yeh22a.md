title: 'Be Like Water: Adaptive Floating Point for Machine Learning'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In the pursuit of optimizing memory and compute density to accelerate machine
  learning applications, reduced precision training and inference has been an active
  area of research. While some approaches selectively apply low precision computations,
  this may require costly off-chip data transfers or mixed precision support. In this
  paper, we propose a novel numerical representation, Adaptive Floating Point (AFP),
  that dynamically adjusts to the characteristics of deep learning data. AFP requires
  no changes to the model topology, requires no additional training, and applies to
  all layers of DNN models. We evaluate AFP on a spectrum of representative models
  in computer vision and NLP, and show that our technique enables ultra-low precision
  inference of deep learning models while providing accuracy comparable to full precision
  inference. By dynamically adjusting to ML data, AFP increases memory density by
  1.6x, 1.6x, and 3.2x and compute density by 4x, 1.3x, and 12x when compared to BFP,
  BFloat16, and FP32.
