title: Re-evaluating Word Mover’s Distance
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The word mover’s distance (WMD) is a fundamental technique for measuring
  the similarity of two documents. As the crux of WMD, it can take advantage of the
  underlying geometry of the word space by employing an optimal transport formulation.
  The original study on WMD reported that WMD outperforms classical baselines such
  as bag-of-words (BOW) and TF-IDF by significant margins in various datasets. In
  this paper, we point out that the evaluation in the original study could be misleading.
  We re-evaluate the performances of WMD and the classical baselines and find that
  the classical baselines are competitive with WMD if we employ an appropriate preprocessing,
  i.e., L1 normalization. In addition, we introduce an analogy between WMD and L1-normalized
  BOW and find that not only the performance of WMD but also the distance values resemble
  those of BOW in high dimensional spaces.
