  Regression: the case of low-dimensional data'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Recently, several theories including the replica method made predictions
  for the generalization error of Kernel Ridge Regression. In some regimes, they predict
  that the method has a ‘spectral bias’: decomposing the true function $f^*$ on the
  eigenbasis of the kernel, it fits well the coefficients associated with the O(P)
  largest eigenvalues, where $P$ is the size of the training set. This prediction
  works very well on benchmark data sets such as images, yet the assumptions these
  approaches make on the data are never satisfied in practice. To clarify when the
  spectral bias prediction holds, we first focus on a one-dimensional model where
  rigorous results are obtained and then use scaling arguments to generalize and test
  our findings in higher dimensions. Our predictions include the classification case
  $f(x)=$sign$(x_1)$ with a data distribution that vanishes at the decision boundary
  $p(x)\sim x_1^{\chi}$. For $\chi>0$ and a Laplace kernel, we find that (i) there
  exists a cross-over ridge $\lambda^*_{d,\chi}(P)\sim P^{-\frac{1}{d+\chi}}$ such
  that for $\lambda\gg \lambda^*_{d,\chi}(P)$, the replica method applies, but not
  for $\lambda\ll\lambda^*_{d,\chi}(P)$, (ii) in the ridge-less case, spectral bias
  predicts the correct training curve exponent only in the limit $d\rightarrow\infty$.'
