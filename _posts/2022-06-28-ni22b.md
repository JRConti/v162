title: Optimal Estimation of Policy Gradient via Double Fitted Iteration
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Policy gradient (PG) estimation becomes a challenge when we are not allowed
  to sample with the target policy but only have access to a dataset generated by
  some unknown behavior policy. Conventional methods for off-policy PG estimation
  often suffer from either significant bias or exponentially large variance. In this
  paper, we propose the double Fitted PG estimation (FPG) algorithm. FPG can work
  with an arbitrary policy parameterization, assuming access to a Bellman-complete
  value function class. In the case of linear value function approximation, we provide
  a tight finite-sample upper bound on policy gradient estimation error, that is governed
  by the amount of distribution mismatch measured in feature space. We also establish
  the asymptotic normality of FPG estimation error with a precise covariance characterization,
  which is further shown to be statistically optimal with a matching Cramer-Rao lower
  bound. Empirically, we evaluate the performance of FPG on both policy gradient estimation
  and policy optimization, using either softmax tabular or ReLU policy networks. Under
  various metrics, our results show that FPG significantly outperforms existing off-policy
  PG estimation methods based on importance sampling and variance reduction techniques.
