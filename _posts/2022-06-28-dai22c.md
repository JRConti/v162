title: Marginal Distribution Adaptation for Discrete Sets via Module-Oriented Divergence
  Minimization
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Distributions over discrete sets capture the essential statistics including
  the high-order correlation among elements. Such information provides powerful insight
  for decision making across various application domains, e.g., product assortment
  based on product distribution in shopping carts. While deep generative models trained
  on pre-collected data can capture existing distributions, such pre-trained models
  are usually not capable of aligning with a target domain in the presence of distribution
  shift due to reasons such as temporal shift or the change in the population mix.
  We develop a general framework to adapt a generative model subject to a (possibly
  counterfactual) target data distribution with both sampling and computation efficiency.
  Concretely, instead of re-training a full model from scratch, we reuse the learned
  modules to preserve the correlations between set elements, while only adjusting
  corresponding components to align with target marginal constraints. We instantiate
  the approach for three commonly used forms of discrete set distribution—latent variable,
  autoregressive, and energy based models—and provide efficient solutions for marginal-constrained
  optimization in either primal or dual forms. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world
  e-commerce and EHR datasets show that the proposed framework is able to practically
  align a generative model to match marginal constraints under distribution shift.
