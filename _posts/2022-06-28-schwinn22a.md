title: Improving Robustness against Real-World and Worst-Case Distribution Shifts
  through Decision Region Quantification
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The reliability of neural networks is essential for their use in safety-critical
  applications. Existing approaches generally aim at improving the robustness of neural
  networks to either real-world distribution shifts (e.g., common corruptions and
  perturbations, spatial transformations, and natural adversarial examples) or worst-case
  distribution shifts (e.g., optimized adversarial examples). In this work, we propose
  the Decision Region Quantification (DRQ) algorithm to improve the robustness of
  any differentiable pre-trained model against both real-world and worst-case distribution
  shifts in the data. DRQ analyzes the robustness of local decision regions in the
  vicinity of a given data point to make more reliable predictions. We theoretically
  motivate the DRQ algorithm by showing that it effectively smooths spurious local
  extrema in the decision surface. Furthermore, we propose an implementation using
  targeted and untargeted adversarial attacks. An extensive empirical evaluation shows
  that DRQ increases the robustness of adversarially and non-adversarially trained
  models against real-world and worst-case distribution shifts on several computer
  vision benchmark datasets.
