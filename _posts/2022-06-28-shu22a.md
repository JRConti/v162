title: Bit Prioritization in Variational Autoencoders via Progressive Coding
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The hierarchical variational autoencoder (HVAE) is a popular generative
  model used for many representation learning tasks. However, its application to image
  synthesis often yields models with poor sample quality. In this work, we treat image
  synthesis itself as a hierarchical representation learning problem and regularize
  an HVAE toward representations that improve the modelâ€™s image synthesis performance.
  We do so by leveraging the progressive coding hypothesis, which claims hierarchical
  latent variable models that are good at progressive lossy compression will generate
  high-quality samples. To test this hypothesis, we first show empirically that conventionally-trained
  HVAEs are not good progressive coders. We then propose a simple method that constrains
  the hierarchical representations to prioritize the encoding of information beneficial
  for lossy compression, and show that this modification leads to improved sample
  quality. Our work lends further support to the progressive coding hypothesis and
  demonstrates that this hypothesis should be exploited when designing variational
  autoencoders.
