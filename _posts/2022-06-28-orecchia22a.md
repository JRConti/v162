title: Practical Almost-Linear-Time Approximation Algorithms for Hybrid and Overlapping
  Graph Clustering
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Detecting communities in real-world networks and clustering similarity graphs
  are major data mining tasks with a wide range of applications in graph mining, collaborative
  filtering, and bioinformatics. In many such applications, overwhelming empirical
  evidence suggests that communities and clusters are naturally overlapping, i.e.,
  the boundary of a cluster may contain both edges across clusters and nodes that
  are shared with other clusters, calling for novel hybrid graph partitioning algorithms
  (HGP). While almost-linear-time approximation algorithms are known for edge-boundary-based
  graph partitioning, little progress has been made on fast algorithms for HGP, even
  in the special case of vertex-boundary-based graph partitioning. In this work, we
  introduce a frame-work based on two novel clustering objectives, which naturally
  extend the well-studied notion of conductance to clusters with hybrid vertex-and
  edge-boundary structure. Our main algorithmic contributions are almost-linear-time
  algorithms O(log n)-approximation algorithms for both these objectives. To this
  end, we show that the cut-matching framework of (Khandekar et al., 2014) can be
  significantly extended to incorporate hybrid partitions. Crucially, we implement
  our approximation algorithm to produce both hybrid partitions and optimality certificates
  for large graphs, easily scaling to tens of millions of edges, and test our implementation
  on real-world datasets against other competitive baselines.
