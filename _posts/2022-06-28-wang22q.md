title: Robustness Verification for Contrastive Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Contrastive adversarial training has successfully improved the robustness
  of contrastive learning (CL). However, the robustness metric used in these methods
  is linked to attack algorithms, image labels and downstream tasks, all of which
  may affect the consistency and reliability of robustness metric for CL. To address
  these problems, this paper proposes a novel Robustness Verification framework for
  Contrastive Learning (RVCL). Furthermore, we use extreme value theory to reveal
  the relationship between the robust radius of the CL encoder and that of the supervised
  downstream task. Extensive experimental results on various benchmark models and
  datasets verify our theoretical findings, and further demonstrate that our proposed
  RVCL is able to evaluate the robustness of both models and images. Our code is available
  at https://github.com/wzekai99/RVCL.
