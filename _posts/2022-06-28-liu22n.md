title: Communication-efficient Distributed Learning for Large Batch Optimization
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Many communication-efficient methods have been proposed for distributed
  learning, whereby gradient compression is used to reduce the communication cost.
  However, given recent advances in large batch optimization (e.g., large batch SGD
  and its variant LARS with layerwise adaptive learning rates), the compute power
  of each machine is being fully utilized. This means, in modern distributed learning,
  the per-machine computation cost is no longer negligible compared to the communication
  cost. In this paper, we propose new gradient compression methods for large batch
  optimization, JointSpar and its variant JointSpar-LARS with layerwise adaptive learning
  rates, that jointly reduce both the computation and the communication cost. To achieve
  this, we take advantage of the redundancy in the gradient computation, unlike the
  existing methods compute all coordinates of the gradient vector, even if some coordinates
  are later dropped for communication efficiency. JointSpar and its variant further
  reduce the training time by avoiding the wasted computation on dropped coordinates.
  While computationally more efficient, we prove that JointSpar and its variant also
  maintain the same convergence rates as their respective baseline methods. Extensive
  experiments show that, by reducing the time per iteration, our methods converge
  faster than state-of-the-art compression methods in terms of wall-clock time.
