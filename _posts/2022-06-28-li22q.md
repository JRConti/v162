title: High Probability Guarantees for Nonconvex Stochastic Gradient Descent with
  Heavy Tails
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is the workhorse in modern machine learning
  and data-driven optimization. Despite its popularity, existing theoretical guarantees
  for SGD are mainly derived in expectation and for convex learning problems. High
  probability guarantees of nonconvex SGD are scarce, and typically rely on “light-tail”
  noise assumptions and study the optimization and generalization performance separately.
  In this paper, we develop high probability bounds for nonconvex SGD with a joint
  perspective of optimization and generalization performance. Instead of the light
  tail assumption, we consider the gradient noise following a heavy-tailed sub-Weibull
  distribution, a novel class generalizing the sub-Gaussian and sub-Exponential families
  to potentially heavier-tailed distributions. Under these complicated settings, we
  first present high probability bounds with best-known rates in general nonconvex
  learning, then move to nonconvex learning with a gradient dominance curvature condition,
  for which we improve the learning guarantees to fast rates. We further obtain sharper
  learning guarantees by considering a mild Bernstein-type noise condition. Our analysis
  also reveals the effect of trade-offs between the optimization and generalization
  performance under different conditions. In the last, we show that gradient clipping
  can be employed to remove the bounded gradient-type assumptions. Additionally, in
  this case, the stepsize of SGD is completely oblivious to the knowledge of smoothness.
