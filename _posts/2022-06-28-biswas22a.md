title: Scalable Spike-and-Slab
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Spike-and-slab priors are commonly used for Bayesian variable selection,
  due to their interpretability and favorable statistical properties. However, existing
  samplers for spike-and-slab posteriors incur prohibitive computational costs when
  the number of variables is large. In this article, we propose Scalable Spike-and-Slab
  (S^3), a scalable Gibbs sampling implementation for high-dimensional Bayesian regression
  with the continuous spike-and-slab prior of George & McCulloch (1993). For a dataset
  with n observations and p covariates, S^3 has order max{n^2 p_t, np} computational
  cost at iteration t where p_t never exceeds the number of covariates switching spike-and-slab
  states between iterations t and t-1 of the Markov chain. This improves upon the
  order n^2 p per-iteration cost of state-of-the-art implementations as, typically,
  p_t is substantially smaller than p. We apply S^3 on synthetic and real-world datasets,
  demonstrating orders of magnitude speed-ups over existing exact samplers and significant
  gains in inferential quality over approximate samplers with comparable cost.
