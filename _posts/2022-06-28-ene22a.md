  Constraints

abstract: Maximizing a monotone k-submodular function subject to cardinality constraints
  is a general model for several applications ranging from influence maximization
  with multiple products to sensor placement with multiple sensor types and online
  ad allocation. Due to the large problem scale in many applications and the online
  nature of ad allocation, a need arises for algorithms that process elements in a
  streaming fashion and possibly make online decisions. In this work, we develop a
  new streaming algorithm for maximizing a monotone k-submodular function subject
  to a per-coordinate cardinality constraint attaining an approximation guarantee
  close to the state of the art guarantee in the offline setting. Though not typical
  for streaming algorithms, our streaming algorithm also readily applies to the online
  setting with free disposal. Our algorithm is combinatorial and enjoys fast running
  time and small number of function evaluations. Furthermore, its guarantee improves
  as the cardinality constraints get larger, which is especially suited for the large
  scale applications. For the special case of maximizing a submodular function with
  large budgets, our combinatorial algorithm matches the guarantee of the state-of-the-art
  continuous algorithm, which requires significantly more time and function evaluations.
