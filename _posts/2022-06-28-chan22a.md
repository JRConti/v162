title: 'UNIREX: A Unified Learning Framework for Language Model Rationale Extraction'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'An extractive rationale explains a language model’s (LM’s) prediction on
  a given task instance by highlighting the text inputs that most influenced the prediction.
  Ideally, rationale extraction should be faithful (reflective of LM’s actual behavior)
  and plausible (convincing to humans), without compromising the LM’s (i.e., task
  model’s) task performance. Although attribution algorithms and select-predict pipelines
  are commonly used in rationale extraction, they both rely on certain heuristics
  that hinder them from satisfying all three desiderata. In light of this, we propose
  UNIREX, a flexible learning framework which generalizes rationale extractor optimization
  as follows: (1) specify architecture for a learned rationale extractor; (2) select
  explainability objectives (\ie faithfulness and plausibility criteria); and (3)
  jointly train the task model and rationale extractor on the task using selected
  objectives. UNIREX enables replacing prior works’ heuristic design choices with
  a generic learned rationale extractor in (1) and optimizing it for all three desiderata
  in (2)-(3). To facilitate comparison between methods w.r.t. multiple desiderata,
  we introduce the Normalized Relative Gain (NRG) metric. On five English text classification
  datasets, our best UNIREX configuration outperforms baselines by an average of 32.9%
  NRG. Plus, UNIREX rationale extractors’ faithfulness can even generalize to unseen
  datasets and tasks.'
