title: 'Beyond Images: Label Noise Transition Matrix Estimation for Tasks with Lower-Quality
  Features'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The label noise transition matrix, denoting the transition probabilities
  from clean labels to noisy labels, is crucial for designing statistically robust
  solutions. Existing estimators for noise transition matrices, e.g., using either
  anchor points or clusterability, focus on computer vision tasks that are relatively
  easier to obtain high-quality representations. We observe that tasks with lower-quality
  features fail to meet the anchor-point or clusterability condition, due to the coexistence
  of both uninformative and informative representations. To handle this issue, we
  propose a generic and practical information-theoretic approach to down-weight the
  less informative parts of the lower-quality features. This improvement is crucial
  to identifying and estimating the label noise transition matrix. The salient technical
  challenge is to compute the relevant information-theoretical metrics using only
  noisy labels instead of clean ones. We prove that the celebrated $f$-mutual information
  measure can often preserve the order when calculated using noisy labels. We then
  build our transition matrix estimator using this distilled version of features.
  The necessity and effectiveness of the proposed method are also demonstrated by
  evaluating the estimation error on a varied set of tabular data and text classification
  tasks with lower-quality features. Code is available at github.com/UCSC-REAL/BeyondImages.
