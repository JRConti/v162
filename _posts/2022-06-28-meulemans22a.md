title: Minimizing Control for Credit Assignment with Strong Feedback
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The success of deep learning ignited interest in whether the brain learns
  hierarchical representations using gradient-based learning. However, current biologically
  plausible methods for gradient-based credit assignment in deep neural networks need
  infinitesimally small feedback signals, which is problematic in biologically realistic
  noisy environments and at odds with experimental evidence in neuroscience showing
  that top-down feedback can significantly influence neural activity. Building upon
  deep feedback control (DFC), a recently proposed credit assignment method, we combine
  strong feedback influences on neural activity with gradient-based learning and show
  that this naturally leads to a novel view on neural network optimization. Instead
  of gradually changing the network weights towards configurations with low output
  loss, weight updates gradually minimize the amount of feedback required from a controller
  that drives the network to the supervised output label. Moreover, we show that the
  use of strong feedback in DFC allows learning forward and feedback connections simultaneously,
  using learning rules fully local in space and time. We complement our theoretical
  results with experiments on standard computer-vision benchmarks, showing competitive
  performance to backpropagation as well as robustness to noise. Overall, our work
  presents a fundamentally novel view of learning as control minimization, while sidestepping
  biologically unrealistic assumptions.
