title: Cycle Representation Learning for Inductive Relation Prediction
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In recent years, algebraic topology and its modern development, the theory
  of persistent homology, has shown great potential in graph representation learning.
  In this paper, based on the mathematics of algebraic topology, we propose a novel
  solution for inductive relation prediction, an important learning task for knowledge
  graph completion. To predict the relation between two entities, one can use the
  existence of rules, namely a sequence of relations. Previous works view rules as
  paths and primarily focus on the searching of paths between entities. The space
  of rules is huge, and one has to sacrifice either efficiency or accuracy. In this
  paper, we consider rules as cycles and show that the space of cycles has a unique
  structure based on the mathematics of algebraic topology. By exploring the linear
  structure of the cycle space, we can improve the searching efficiency of rules.
  We propose to collect cycle bases that span the space of cycles. We build a novel
  GNN framework on the collected cycles to learn the representations of cycles, and
  to predict the existence/non-existence of a relation. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
  performance on benchmarks.
