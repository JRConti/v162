title: 'POEM: Out-of-Distribution Detection with Posterior Sampling'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is indispensable for machine learning
  models deployed in the open world. Recently, the use of an auxiliary outlier dataset
  during training (also known as outlier exposure) has shown promising performance.
  As the sample space for potential OOD data can be prohibitively large, sampling
  informative outliers is essential. In this work, we propose a novel posterior sampling
  based outlier mining framework, POEM, which facilitates efficient use of outlier
  data and promotes learning a compact decision boundary between ID and OOD data for
  improved detection. We show that POEM establishes state-of-the-art performance on
  common benchmarks. Compared to the current best method that uses a greedy sampling
  strategy, POEM improves the relative performance by 42.0% and 24.2% (FPR95) on CIFAR-10
  and CIFAR-100, respectively. We further provide theoretical insights on the effectiveness
  of POEM for OOD detection.
