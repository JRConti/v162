title: Approximately Equivariant Networks for Imperfectly Symmetric Dynamics
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Incorporating symmetry as an inductive bias into neural network architecture
  has led to improvements in generalization, data efficiency, and physical consistency
  in dynamics modeling. Methods such as CNNs or equivariant neural networks use weight
  tying to enforce symmetries such as shift invariance or rotational equivariance.
  However, despite the fact that physical laws obey many symmetries, real-world dynamical
  data rarely conforms to strict mathematical symmetry either due to noisy or incomplete
  data or to symmetry breaking features in the underlying dynamical system. We explore
  approximately equivariant networks which are biased towards preserving symmetry
  but are not strictly constrained to do so. By relaxing equivariance constraints,
  we find that our models can outperform both baselines with no symmetry bias and
  baselines with overly strict symmetry in both simulated turbulence domains and real-world
  multi-stream jet flow.
