title: Equivariant Diffusion for Molecule Generation in 3D
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: This work introduces a diffusion model for molecule generation in 3D that
  is equivariant to Euclidean transformations. Our E(3) Equivariant Diffusion Model
  (EDM) learns to denoise a diffusion process with an equivariant network that jointly
  operates on both continuous (atom coordinates) and categorical features (atom types).
  In addition, we provide a probabilistic analysis which admits likelihood computation
  of molecules using our model. Experimentally, the proposed method significantly
  outperforms previous 3D molecular generative methods regarding the quality of generated
  samples and the efficiency at training time.
