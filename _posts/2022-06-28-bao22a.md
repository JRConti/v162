title: Learning Stable Classifiers by Transferring Unstable Features
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: While unbiased machine learning models are essential for many applications,
  bias is a human-defined concept that can vary across tasks. Given only input-label
  pairs, algorithms may lack sufficient information to distinguish stable (causal)
  features from unstable (spurious) features. However, related tasks often share similar
  biases â€“ an observation we may leverage to develop stable classifiers in the transfer
  setting. In this work, we explicitly inform the target classifier about unstable
  features in the source tasks. Specifically, we derive a representation that encodes
  the unstable features by contrasting different data environments in the source task.
  We achieve robustness by clustering data of the target task according to this representation
  and minimizing the worst-case risk across these clusters. We evaluate our method
  on both text and image classifications. Empirical results demonstrate that our algorithm
  is able to maintain robustness on the target task for both synthetically generated
  environments and real-world environments. Our code is available at https://github.com/YujiaBao/Tofu.
