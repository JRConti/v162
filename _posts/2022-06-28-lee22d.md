title: A Statistical Manifold Framework for Point Cloud Data
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Many problems in machine learning involve data sets in which each data
  point is a point cloud in $\mathbb{R}^D$. A growing number of applications require
  a means of measuring not only distances between point clouds, but also angles, volumes,
  derivatives, and other more advanced concepts. To formulate and quantify these concepts
  in a coordinate-invariant way, we develop a Riemannian geometric framework for point
  cloud data. By interpreting each point in a point cloud as a sample drawn from some
  given underlying probability density, the space of point cloud data can be given
  the structure of a statistical manifold – each point on this manifold represents
  a point cloud – with the Fisher information metric acting as a natural Riemannian
  metric. Two autoencoder applications of our framework are presented: (i) smoothly
  deforming one 3D object into another via interpolation between the two corresponding
  point clouds; (ii) learning an optimal set of latent space coordinates for point
  cloud data that best preserves angles and distances, and thus produces a more discriminative
  representation space. Experiments with large-scale standard benchmark point cloud
  data show greatly improved classification accuracy vis-á-vis existing methods. Code
