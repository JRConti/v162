title: Confidence Score for Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SFUDA) aims to obtain high
  performance in the unlabeled target domain using the pre-trained source model, not
  the source data. Existing SFUDA methods assign the same importance to all target
  samples, which is vulnerable to incorrect pseudo-labels. To differentiate between
  sample importance, in this study, we propose a novel sample-wise confidence score,
  the Joint Model-Data Structure (JMDS) score for SFUDA. Unlike existing confidence
  scores that use only one of the source or target domain knowledge, the JMDS score
  uses both knowledge. We then propose a Confidence score Weighting Adaptation using
  the JMDS (CoWA-JMDS) framework for SFUDA. CoWA-JMDS consists of the JMDS scores
  as sample weights and weight Mixup that is our proposed variant of Mixup. Weight
  Mixup promotes the model make more use of the target domain knowledge. The experimental
  results show that the JMDS score outperforms the existing confidence scores. Moreover,
  CoWA-JMDS achieves state-of-the-art performance on various SFUDA scenarios: closed,
  open, and partial-set scenarios.'
