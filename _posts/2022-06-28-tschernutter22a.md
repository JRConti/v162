title: Interpretable Off-Policy Learning via Hyperbox Search
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Personalized treatment decisions have become an integral part of modern
  medicine. Thereby, the aim is to make treatment decisions based on individual patient
  characteristics. Numerous methods have been developed for learning such policies
  from observational data that achieve the best outcome across a certain policy class.
  Yet these methods are rarely interpretable. However, interpretability is often a
  prerequisite for policy learning in clinical practice. In this paper, we propose
  an algorithm for interpretable off-policy learning via hyperbox search. In particular,
  our policies can be represented in disjunctive normal form (i.e., OR-of-ANDs) and
  are thus intelligible. We prove a universal approximation theorem that shows that
  our policy class is flexible enough to approximate any measurable function arbitrarily
  well. For optimization, we develop a tailored column generation procedure within
  a branch-and-bound framework. Using a simulation study, we demonstrate that our
  algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods from interpretable off-policy learning
  in terms of regret. Using real-word clinical data, we perform a user study with
  actual clinical experts, who rate our policies as highly interpretable.
