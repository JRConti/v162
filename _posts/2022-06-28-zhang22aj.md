title: Building Robust Ensembles via Margin Boosting
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In the context of adversarial robustness, a single model does not usually
  have enough power to defend against all possible adversarial attacks, and as a result,
  has sub-optimal robustness. Consequently, an emerging line of work has focused on
  learning an ensemble of neural networks to defend against adversarial attacks. In
  this work, we take a principled approach towards building robust ensembles. We view
  this problem from the perspective of margin-boosting and develop an algorithm for
  learning an ensemble with maximum margin. Through extensive empirical evaluation
  on benchmark datasets, we show that our algorithm not only outperforms existing
  ensembling techniques, but also large models trained in an end-to-end fashion. An
  important byproduct of our work is a margin-maximizing cross-entropy (MCE) loss,
  which is a better alternative to the standard cross-entropy (CE) loss. Empirically,
  we show that replacing the CE loss in state-of-the-art adversarial training techniques
  with our MCE loss leads to significant performance improvement.
