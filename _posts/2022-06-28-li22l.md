title: Deconfounded Value Decomposition for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Value decomposition (VD) methods have been widely used in cooperative multi-agent
  reinforcement learning (MARL), where credit assignment plays an important role in
  guiding the agentsâ€™ decentralized execution. In this paper, we investigate VD from
  a novel perspective of causal inference. We first show that the environment in existing
  VD methods is an unobserved confounder as the common cause factor of the global
  state and the joint value function, which leads to the confounding bias on learning
  credit assignment. We then present our approach, deconfounded value decomposition
  (DVD), which cuts off the backdoor confounding path from the global state to the
  joint value function. The cut is implemented by introducing the <em>trajectory graph</em>,
  which depends only on the local trajectories, as a proxy confounder. DVD is general
  enough to be applied to various VD methods, and extensive experiments show that
  DVD can consistently achieve significant performance gains over different state-of-the-art
  VD methods on StarCraft II and MACO benchmarks.
