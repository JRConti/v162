title: 'Neurotoxin: Durable Backdoors in Federated Learning'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Federated learning (FL) systems have an inherent vulnerability to adversarial
  backdoor attacks during training due to their decentralized nature. The goal of
  the attacker is to implant backdoors in the learned model with poisoned updates
  such that at test time, the model’s outputs can be fixed to a given target for certain
  inputs (e.g., if a user types “people from New York” into a mobile keyboard app
  that uses a backdoored next word prediction model, the model will autocomplete their
  sentence to “people in New York are rude”). Prior work has shown that backdoors
  can be inserted in FL, but these backdoors are not durable: they do not remain in
  the model after the attacker stops uploading poisoned updates because training continues,
  and in production FL systems an inserted backdoor may not survive until deployment.
  We propose Neurotoxin, a simple one-line backdoor attack that functions by attacking
  parameters that are changed less in magnitude during training. We conduct an exhaustive
  evaluation across ten natural language processing and computer vision tasks and
  find that we can double the durability of state of the art backdoors by adding a
  single line with Neurotoxin.'
