title: Robust Imitation Learning against Variations in Environment Dynamics
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In this paper, we propose a robust imitation learning (IL) framework that
  improves the robustness of IL when environment dynamics are perturbed. The existing
  IL framework trained in a single environment can catastrophically fail with perturbations
  in environment dynamics because it does not capture the situation that underlying
  environment dynamics can be changed. Our framework effectively deals with environments
  with varying dynamics by imitating multiple experts in sampled environment dynamics
  to enhance the robustness in general variations in environment dynamics. In order
  to robustly imitate the multiple sample experts, we minimize the risk with respect
  to the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the agentâ€™s policy and each of the sample
  experts. Numerical results show that our algorithm significantly improves robustness
  against dynamics perturbations compared to conventional IL baselines.
