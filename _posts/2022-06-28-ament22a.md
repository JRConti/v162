title: Scalable First-Order Bayesian Optimization via Structured Automatic Differentiation
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) has shown great promise for the global optimization
  of functions that are expensive to evaluate, but despite many successes, standard
  approaches can struggle in high dimensions. To improve the performance of BO, prior
  work suggested incorporating gradient information into a Gaussian process surrogate
  of the objective, giving rise to kernel matrices of size $nd$ {\texttimes} $nd$
  for $n$ observations in $d$ dimensions. Naı̈vely multiplying with (resp. inverting)
  these matrices requires $O(n^2d^2)$ (resp. $O(n^3d^3)$) operations, which becomes
  infeasible for moderate dimensions and sample sizes. Here, we observe that a wide
  range of kernels gives rise to structured matrices, enabling an exact $O(n^2d)$
  matrix-vector multiply for gradient observations and $O(n^2d^2)$ for Hessian observations.
  Beyond canonical kernel classes, we derive a programmatic approach to leveraging
  this type of structure for transformations and combinations of the discussed kernel
  classes, which constitutes a structure-aware automatic differentiation algorithm.
  Our methods apply to virtually all canonical kernels and automatically extend to
  complex kernels, like the neural network, radial basis function network, and spectral
  mixture kernels without any additional derivations, enabling flexible, problem-dependent
  modeling while scaling first-order BO to high $d$.
