title: Label-Descriptive Patterns and Their Application to Characterizing Classification
  Errors
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: State-of-the-art deep learning methods achieve human-like performance on
  many tasks, but make errors nevertheless. Characterizing these errors in easily
  interpretable terms gives insight into whether a classifier is prone to making systematic
  errors, but also gives a way to act and improve the classifier. We propose to discover
  those feature-value combinations (i.e., patterns) that strongly correlate with correct
  resp. erroneous predictions to obtain a global and interpretable description for
  arbitrary classifiers. We show this is an instance of the more general label description
  problem, which we formulate in terms of the Minimum Description Length principle.
  To discover a good pattern set, we develop the efficient Premise algorithm. Through
  an extensive set of experiments we show it performs very well in practice on both
  synthetic and real-world data. Unlike existing solutions, it ably recovers ground
  truth patterns, even on highly imbalanced data over many features. Through two case
  studies on Visual Question Answering and Named Entity Recognition, we confirm that
  Premise gives clear and actionable insight into the systematic errors made by modern
  NLP classifiers.
