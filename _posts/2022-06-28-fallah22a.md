title: Variational Sparse Coding with Learned Thresholding
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Sparse coding strategies have been lauded for their parsimonious representations
  of data that leverage low dimensional structure. However, inference of these codes
  typically relies on an optimization procedure with poor computational scaling in
  high-dimensional problems. For example, sparse inference in the representations
  learned in the high-dimensional intermediary layers of deep neural networks (DNNs)
  requires an iterative minimization to be performed at each training step. As such,
  recent, quick methods in variational inference have been proposed to infer sparse
  codes by learning a distribution over the codes with a DNN. In this work, we propose
  a new approach to variational sparse coding that allows us to learn sparse distributions
  by thresholding samples, avoiding the use of problematic relaxations. We first evaluate
  and analyze our method by training a linear generator, showing that it has superior
  performance, statistical efficiency, and gradient estimation compared to other sparse
  distributions. We then compare to a standard variational autoencoder using a DNN
  generator on the CelebA dataset.
