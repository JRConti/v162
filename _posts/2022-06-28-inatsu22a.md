title: Bayesian Optimization for Distributionally Robust Chance-constrained Problem
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In black-box function optimization, we need to consider not only controllable
  design variables but also uncontrollable stochastic environment variables. In such
  cases, it is necessary to solve the optimization problem by taking into account
  the uncertainty of the environmental variables. Chance-constrained (CC) problem,
  the problem of maximizing the expected value under a certain level of constraint
  satisfaction probability, is one of the practically important problems in the presence
  of environmental variables. In this study, we consider distributionally robust CC
  (DRCC) problem and propose a novel DRCC Bayesian optimization method for the case
  where the distribution of the environmental variables cannot be precisely specified.
  We show that the proposed method can find an arbitrary accurate solution with high
  probability in a finite number of trials, and confirm the usefulness of the proposed
  method through numerical experiments.
