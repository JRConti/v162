title: Global Optimization Networks
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We consider the problem of estimating a good maximizer of a black-box function
  given noisy examples. We propose to fit a new type of function called a global optimization
  network (GON), defined as any composition of an invertible function and a unimodal
  function, whose unique global maximizer can be inferred in $\mathcal{O}(D)$ time,
  and used as the estimate. As an example way to construct GON functions, and interesting
  in its own right, we give new results for specifying multi-dimensional unimodal
  functions using lattice models with linear inequality constraints. We extend to
  <em>conditional</em> GONs that find a global maximizer conditioned on specified
  inputs of other dimensions. Experiments show the GON maximizers are statistically
  significantly better predictions than those produced by convex fits, GPR, or DNNs,
  and form more reasonable predictions for real-world problems.
