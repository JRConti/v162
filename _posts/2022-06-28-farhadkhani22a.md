title: Byzantine Machine Learning Made Easy By Resilient Averaging of Momentums
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Byzantine resilience emerged as a prominent topic within the distributed
  machine learning community. Essentially, the goal is to enhance distributed optimization
  algorithms, such as distributed SGD, in a way that guarantees convergence despite
  the presence of some misbehaving (a.k.a., <em>Byzantine</em>) workers. Although
  a myriad of techniques addressing the problem have been proposed, the field arguably
  rests on fragile foundations. These techniques are hard to prove correct and rely
  on assumptions that are (a) quite unrealistic, i.e., often violated in practice,
  and (b) heterogeneous, i.e., making it difficult to compare approaches. We present
  <em>RESAM (RESilient Averaging of Momentums)</em>, a unified framework that makes
  it simple to establish optimal Byzantine resilience, relying only on standard machine
  learning assumptions. Our framework is mainly composed of two operators: <em>resilient
  averaging</em> at the server and <em>distributed momentum</em> at the workers. We
  prove a general theorem stating the convergence of distributed SGD under RESAM.
  Interestingly, demonstrating and comparing the convergence of many existing techniques
  become direct corollaries of our theorem, without resorting to stringent assumptions.
  We also present an empirical evaluation of the practical relevance of RESAM.'
