title: Communication-Efficient Adaptive Federated Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Federated learning is a machine learning training paradigm that enables
  clients to jointly train models without sharing their own localized data. However,
  the implementation of federated learning in practice still faces numerous challenges,
  such as the large communication overhead due to the repetitive server-client synchronization
  and the lack of adaptivity by SGD-based model updates. Despite that various methods
  have been proposed for reducing the communication cost by gradient compression or
  quantization, and the federated versions of adaptive optimizers such as FedAdam
  are proposed to add more adaptivity, the current federated learning framework still
  cannot solve the aforementioned challenges all at once. In this paper, we propose
  a novel communication-efficient adaptive federated learning method (FedCAMS) with
  theoretical convergence guarantees. We show that in the nonconvex stochastic optimization
  setting, our proposed FedCAMS achieves the same convergence rate of $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{TKm}})$
  as its non-compressed counterparts. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks
  verify our theoretical analysis.
