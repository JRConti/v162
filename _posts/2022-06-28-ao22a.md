title: 'EAT-C: Environment-Adversarial sub-Task Curriculum for Efficient Reinforcement
  Learning'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Reinforcement learning (RL) is inefficient on long-horizon tasks due to
  sparse rewards and its policy can be fragile to slightly perturbed environments.
  We address these challenges via a curriculum of tasks with coupled environments,
  generated by two policies trained jointly with RL: (1) a co-operative planning policy
  recursively decomposing a hard task into a coarse-to-fine sub-task tree; and (2)
  an adversarial policy modifying the environment in each sub-task. They are complementary
  to acquire more informative feedback for RL: (1) provides dense reward of easier
  sub-tasks while (2) modifies sub-tasks’ environments to be more challenging and
  diverse. Conversely, they are trained by RL’s dense feedback on sub-tasks so their
  generated curriculum keeps adaptive to RL’s progress. The sub-task tree enables
  an easy-to-hard curriculum for every policy: its top-down construction gradually
  increases sub-tasks the planner needs to generate, while the adversarial training
  between the environment and RL follows a bottom-up traversal that starts from a
  dense sequence of easier sub-tasks allowing more frequent environment changes. We
  compare EAT-C with RL/planning targeting similar problems and methods with environment
  generators or adversarial agents. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks demonstrate
  the advantages of our method on improving RL’s efficiency and generalization.'
