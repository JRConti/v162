  datasets'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Deep neural networks usually perform poorly when the training dataset suffers
  from extreme class imbalance. Recent studies found that directly training with out-of-distribution
  data (i.e., open-set samples) in a semi-supervised manner would harm the generalization
  performance. In this work, we theoretically show that out-of-distribution data can
  still be leveraged to augment the minority classes from a Bayesian perspective.
  Based on this motivation, we propose a novel method called Open-sampling, which
  utilizes open-set noisy labels to re-balance the class priors of the training dataset.
  For each open-set instance, the label is sampled from our pre-defined distribution
  that is complementary to the distribution of original class priors. We empirically
  show that Open-sampling not only re-balances the class priors but also encourages
  the neural network to learn separable representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate
  that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing data re-balancing methods
  and can boost the performance of existing state-of-the-art methods.
