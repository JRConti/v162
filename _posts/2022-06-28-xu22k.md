title: 'SkexGen: Autoregressive Generation of CAD Construction Sequences with Disentangled
  Codebooks'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We present SkexGen, a novel autoregressive generative model for computer-aided
  design (CAD) construction sequences containing sketch-and-extrude modeling operations.
  Our model utilizes distinct Transformer architectures to encode topological, geometric,
  and extrusion variations of construction sequences into disentangled codebooks.
  Autoregressive Transformer decoders generate CAD construction sequences sharing
  certain properties specified by the codebook vectors. Extensive experiments demonstrate
  that our disentangled codebook representation generates diverse and high-quality
  CAD models, enhances user control, and enables efficient exploration of the design
  space. The code is available at https://samxuxiang.github.io/skexgen.
