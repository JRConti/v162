title: 'StreamingQA: A Benchmark for Adaptation to New Knowledge over Time in Question
  Answering Models'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Knowledge and language understanding of models evaluated through question
  answering (QA) has been usually studied on static snapshots of knowledge, like Wikipedia.
  However, our world is dynamic, evolves over time, and our models’ knowledge becomes
  outdated. To study how semi-parametric QA models and their underlying parametric
  language models (LMs) adapt to evolving knowledge, we construct a new large-scale
  dataset, StreamingQA, with human written and generated questions asked on a given
  date, to be answered from 14 years of time-stamped news articles. We evaluate our
  models quarterly as they read new articles not seen in pre-training. We show that
  parametric models can be updated without full retraining, while avoiding catastrophic
  forgetting. For semi-parametric models, adding new articles into the search space
  allows for rapid adaptation, however, models with an outdated underlying LM under-perform
  those with a retrained LM. For questions about higher-frequency named entities,
  parametric updates are particularly beneficial. In our dynamic world, the StreamingQA
  dataset enables a more realistic evaluation of QA models, and our experiments highlight
  several promising directions for future research.
