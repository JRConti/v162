title: Context-Aware Drift Detection
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: When monitoring machine learning systems, two-sample tests of homogeneity
  form the foundation upon which existing approaches to drift detection build. They
  are used to test for evidence that the distribution underlying recent deployment
  data differs from that underlying the historical reference data. Often, however,
  various factors such as time-induced correlation mean that batches of recent deployment
  data are not expected to form an i.i.d. sample from the historical data distribution.
  Instead we may wish to test for differences in the distributions conditional on
  <em>context</em> that is permitted to change. To facilitate this we borrow machinery
  from the causal inference domain to develop a more general drift detection framework
  built upon a foundation of two-sample tests for conditional distributional treatment
  effects. We recommend a particular instantiation of the framework based on maximum
  conditional mean discrepancies. We then provide an empirical study demonstrating
  its effectiveness for various drift detection problems of practical interest, such
  as detecting drift in the distributions underlying subpopulations of data in a manner
  that is insensitive to their respective prevalences. The study additionally demonstrates
  applicability to ImageNet-scale vision problems.
