title: 'Modality Competition: What Makes Joint Training of Multi-modal Network Fail
  in Deep Learning? (Provably)'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Despite the remarkable success of deep multi-modal learning in practice,
  it has not been well-explained in theory. Recently, it has been observed that the
  best uni-modal network outperforms the jointly trained multi-modal network across
  different combinations of modalities on various tasks, which is counter-intuitive
  since multiple signals would bring more information (Wang et al., 2020). This work
  provides a theoretical explanation for the emergence of such performance gap in
  neural networks for the prevalent joint training framework. Based on a simplified
  data distribution that captures the realistic property of multi-modal data, we prove
  that for multi-modal late-fusion network with (smoothed) ReLU activation trained
  jointly by gradient descent, different modalities will compete with each other and
  only a subset of modalities will be learned by its corresponding encoder networks.
  We refer to this phenomenon as modality competition, and the losing modalities,
  which fail to be discovered, are the origins where the sub-optimality of joint training
  comes from. In contrast, for uni-modal networks with similar learning settings,
  we provably show that the networks will focus on learning modality-associated features.
  Experimentally, we illustrate that modality competition matches the intrinsic behavior
  of late-fusion joint training to supplement our theoretical results. To the best
  of our knowledge, our work is the first theoretical treatment towards the degenerating
  aspect of multi-modal learning in neural networks.
