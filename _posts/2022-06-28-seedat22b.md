title: Continuous-Time Modeling of Counterfactual Outcomes Using Neural Controlled
  Differential Equations
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Estimating counterfactual outcomes over time has the potential to unlock
  personalized healthcare by assisting decision-makers to answer "what-if" questions.
  Existing causal inference approaches typically consider regular, discrete-time intervals
  between observations and treatment decisions and hence are unable to naturally model
  irregularly sampled data, which is the common setting in practice. To handle arbitrary
  observation patterns, we interpret the data as samples from an underlying continuous-time
  process and propose to model its latent trajectory explicitly using the mathematics
  of controlled differential equations. This leads to a new approach, the Treatment
  Effect Neural Controlled Differential Equation (TE-CDE), that allows the potential
  outcomes to be evaluated at any time point. In addition, adversarial training is
  used to adjust for time-dependent confounding which is critical in longitudinal
  settings and is an added challenge not encountered in conventional time series.
  To assess solutions to this problem, we propose a controllable simulation environment
  based on a model of tumor growth for a range of scenarios with irregular sampling
  reflective of a variety of clinical scenarios. TE-CDE consistently outperforms existing
  approaches in all scenarios with irregular sampling.
