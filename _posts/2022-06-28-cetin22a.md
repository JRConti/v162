title: Stabilizing Off-Policy Deep Reinforcement Learning from Pixels
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) from pixel observations is notoriously
  unstable. As a result, many successful algorithms must combine different domain-specific
  practices and auxiliary losses to learn meaningful behaviors in complex environments.
  In this work, we provide novel analysis demonstrating that these instabilities arise
  from performing temporal-difference learning with a convolutional encoder and low-magnitude
  rewards. We show that this new visual deadly triad causes unstable training and
  premature convergence to degenerate solutions, a phenomenon we name catastrophic
  self-overfitting. Based on our analysis, we propose A-LIX, a method providing adaptive
  regularization to the encoderâ€™s gradients that explicitly prevents the occurrence
  of catastrophic self-overfitting using a dual objective. By applying A-LIX, we significantly
  outperform the prior state-of-the-art on the DeepMind Control and Atari benchmarks
  without any data augmentation or auxiliary losses.
