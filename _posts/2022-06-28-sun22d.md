title: Out-of-Distribution Detection with Deep Nearest Neighbors
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical task for deploying machine
  learning models in the open world. Distance-based methods have demonstrated promise,
  where testing samples are detected as OOD if they are relatively far away from in-distribution
  (ID) data. However, prior methods impose a strong distributional assumption of the
  underlying feature space, which may not always hold. In this paper, we explore the
  efficacy of non-parametric nearest-neighbor distance for OOD detection, which has
  been largely overlooked in the literature. Unlike prior works, our method does not
  impose any distributional assumption, hence providing stronger flexibility and generality.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of nearest-neighbor-based OOD detection on several
  benchmarks and establish superior performance. Under the same model trained on ImageNet-1k,
  our method substantially reduces the false positive rate (FPR@TPR95) by 24.77% compared
  to a strong baseline SSD+, which uses a parametric approach Mahalanobis distance
  in detection. Code is available: https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/knn-ood.'
