title: Provably Efficient Offline Reinforcement Learning for Partially Observable
  Markov Decision Processes
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We study offline reinforcement learning (RL) for partially observable Markov
  decision processes (POMDPs) with possibly infinite state and observation spaces.
  Under the undercompleteness assumption, the optimal policy in such POMDPs are characterized
  by a class of finite-memory Bellman operators. In the offline setting, estimating
  these operators directly is challenging due to (i) the large observation space and
  (ii) insufficient coverage of the offline dataset. To tackle these challenges, we
  propose a novel algorithm that constructs confidence regions for these Bellman operators
  via offline estimation of their RKHS embeddings, and returns the final policy via
  pessimistic planning within the confidence regions. We prove that the proposed algorithm
  attains an \(\epsilon\)-optimal policy using an offline dataset containing \(\tilde\cO(1
  / \epsilon^2)\){episodes}, provided that the behavior policy has good coverage over
  the optimal trajectory. To our best knowledge, our algorithm is the first provably
  sample efficient offline algorithm for POMDPs without uniform coverage assumptions.
