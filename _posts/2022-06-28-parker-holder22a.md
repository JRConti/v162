title: Evolving Curricula with Regret-Based Environment Design
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Training generally-capable agents with reinforcement learning (RL) remains
  a significant challenge. A promising avenue for improving the robustness of RL agents
  is through the use of curricula. One such class of methods frames environment design
  as a game between a student and a teacher, using regret-based objectives to produce
  environment instantiations (or levels) at the frontier of the student agent’s capabilities.
  These methods benefit from theoretical robustness guarantees at equilibrium, yet
  they often struggle to find effective levels in challenging design spaces in practice.
  By contrast, evolutionary approaches incrementally alter environment complexity,
  resulting in potentially open-ended learning, but often rely on domain-specific
  heuristics and vast amounts of computational resources. This work proposes harnessing
  the power of evolution in a principled, regret-based curriculum. Our approach, which
  we call Adversarially Compounding Complexity by Editing Levels (ACCEL), seeks to
  constantly produce levels at the frontier of an agent’s capabilities, resulting
  in curricula that start simple but become increasingly complex. ACCEL maintains
  the theoretical benefits of prior regret-based methods, while providing significant
  empirical gains in a diverse set of environments. An interactive version of this
  paper is available at https://accelagent.github.io.
