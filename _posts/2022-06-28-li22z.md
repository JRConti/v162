title: Hessian-Free High-Resolution Nesterov Acceleration For Sampling
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Nesterovâ€™s Accelerated Gradient (NAG) for optimization has better performance
  than its continuous time limit (noiseless kinetic Langevin) when a finite step-size
  is employed (Shi et al., 2021). This work explores the sampling counterpart of this
  phenonemon and proposes a diffusion process, whose discretizations can yield accelerated
  gradient-based MCMC methods. More precisely, we reformulate the optimizer of NAG
  for strongly convex functions (NAG-SC) as a Hessian-Free High-Resolution ODE, change
  its high-resolution coefficient to a hyperparameter, inject appropriate noise, and
  discretize the resulting diffusion process. The acceleration effect of the new hyperparameter
  is quantified and it is not an artificial one created by time-rescaling. Instead,
  acceleration beyond underdamped Langevin in $W_2$ distance is quantitatively established
  for log-strongly-concave-and-smooth targets, at both the continuous dynamics level
  and the discrete algorithm level. Empirical experiments in both log-strongly-concave
  and multi-modal cases also numerically demonstrate this acceleration.
