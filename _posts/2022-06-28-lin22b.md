title: Federated Learning with Positive and Unlabeled Data
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We study the problem of learning from positive and unlabeled (PU) data in
  the federated setting, where each client only labels a little part of their dataset
  due to the limitation of resources and time. Different from the settings in traditional
  PU learning where the negative class consists of a single class, the negative samples
  which cannot be identified by a client in the federated setting may come from multiple
  classes which are unknown to the client. Therefore, existing PU learning methods
  can be hardly applied in this situation. To address this problem, we propose a novel
  framework, namely Federated learning with Positive and Unlabeled data (FedPU), to
  minimize the expected risk of multiple negative classes by leveraging the labeled
  data in other clients. We theoretically analyze the generalization bound of the
  proposed FedPU. Empirical experiments show that the FedPU can achieve much better
  performance than conventional supervised and semi-supervised federated learning
  methods.
