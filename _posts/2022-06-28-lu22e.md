title: Multi-slots Online Matching with High Entropy
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Online matching with diversity and fairness pursuit, a common building block
  in the recommendation and advertising, can be modeled as constrained convex programming
  with high entropy. While most existing approaches are based on the “single slot”
  assumption (i.e., assigning one item per iteration), they cannot be directly applied
  to cases with multiple slots, e.g., stock-aware top-N recommendation and advertising
  at multiple places. Particularly, the gradient computation and resource allocation
  are both challenging under this setting due to the absence of a closed-form solution.
  To overcome these obstacles, we develop a novel algorithm named Online subGradient
  descent for Multi-slots Allocation (OG-MA). It uses an efficient pooling algorithm
  to compute closed-form of the gradient then performs a roulette swapping for allocation,
  yielding a sub-linear regret with linear cost per iteration. Extensive experiments
  on synthetic and industrial data sets demonstrate that OG-MA is a fast and promising
  method for multi-slots online matching.
