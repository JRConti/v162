title: Continual Learning with Guarantees via Weight Interval Constraints
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We introduce a new training paradigm that enforces interval constraints
  on neural network parameter space to control forgetting. Contemporary Continual
  Learning (CL) methods focus on training neural networks efficiently from a stream
  of data, while reducing the negative impact of catastrophic forgetting, yet they
  do not provide any firm guarantees that network performance will not deteriorate
  uncontrollably over time. In this work, we show how to put bounds on forgetting
  by reformulating continual learning of a model as a continual contraction of its
  parameter space. To that end, we propose Hyperrectangle Training, a new training
  methodology where each task is represented by a hyperrectangle in the parameter
  space, fully contained in the hyperrectangles of the previous tasks. This formulation
  reduces the NP-hard CL problem back to polynomial time while providing full resilience
  against forgetting. We validate our claim by developing InterContiNet (Interval
  Continual Learning) algorithm which leverages interval arithmetic to effectively
  model parameter regions as hyperrectangles. Through experimental results, we show
  that our approach performs well in a continual learning setup without storing data
  from previous tasks.
