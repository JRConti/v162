title: Action-Sufficient State Representation Learning for Control with Structural
  Constraints
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Perceived signals in real-world scenarios are usually high-dimensional and
  noisy, and finding and using their representation that contains essential and sufficient
  information required by downstream decision-making tasks will help improve computational
  efficiency and generalization ability in the tasks. In this paper, we focus on partially
  observable environments and propose to learn a minimal set of state representations
  that capture sufficient information for decision-making, termed Action-Sufficient
  state Representations (ASRs). We build a generative environment model for the structural
  relationships among variables in the system and present a principled way to characterize
  ASRs based on structural constraints and the goal of maximizing cumulative reward
  in policy learning. We then develop a structured sequential Variational Auto-Encoder
  to estimate the environment model and extract ASRs. Our empirical results on CarRacing
  and VizDoom demonstrate a clear advantage of learning and using ASRs for policy
  learning. Moreover, the estimated environment model and ASRs allow learning behaviors
  from imagined outcomes in the compact latent space to improve sample efficiency.
