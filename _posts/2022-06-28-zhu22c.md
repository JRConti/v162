title: Neural-Symbolic Models for Logical Queries on Knowledge Graphs
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Answering complex first-order logic (FOL) queries on knowledge graphs is
  a fundamental task for multi-hop reasoning. Traditional symbolic methods traverse
  a complete knowledge graph to extract the answers, which provides good interpretation
  for each step. Recent neural methods learn geometric embeddings for complex queries.
  These methods can generalize to incomplete knowledge graphs, but their reasoning
  process is hard to interpret. In this paper, we propose Graph Neural Network Query
  Executor (GNN-QE), a neural-symbolic model that enjoys the advantages of both worlds.
  GNN-QE decomposes a complex FOL query into relation projections and logical operations
  over fuzzy sets, which provides interpretability for intermediate variables. To
  reason about the missing links, GNN-QE adapts a graph neural network from knowledge
  graph completion to execute the relation projections, and models the logical operations
  with product fuzzy logic. Experiments on 3 datasets show that GNN-QE significantly
  improves over previous state-of-the-art models in answering FOL queries. Meanwhile,
  GNN-QE can predict the number of answers without explicit supervision, and provide
  visualizations for intermediate variables.
