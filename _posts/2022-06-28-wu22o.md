title: 'RetrievalGuard: Provably Robust 1-Nearest Neighbor Image Retrieval'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Recent research works have shown that image retrieval models are vulnerable
  to adversarial attacks, where slightly modified test inputs could lead to problematic
  retrieval results. In this paper, we aim to design a provably robust image retrieval
  model which keeps the most important evaluation metric Recall@1 invariant to adversarial
  perturbation. We propose the first 1-nearest neighbor (NN) image retrieval algorithm,
  RetrievalGuard, which is provably robust against adversarial perturbations within
  an $\ell_2$ ball of calculable radius. The challenge is to design a provably robust
  algorithm that takes into consideration the 1-NN search and the high-dimensional
  nature of the embedding space. Algorithmically, given a base retrieval model and
  a query sample, we build a smoothed retrieval model by carefully analyzing the 1-NN
  search procedure in the high-dimensional embedding space. We show that the smoothed
  retrieval model has bounded Lipschitz constant and thus the retrieval score is invariant
  to $\ell_2$ adversarial perturbations. Experiments on on image retrieval tasks validate
  the robustness of our RetrievalGuard method.
