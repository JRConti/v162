title: Short-Term Plasticity Neurons Learning to Learn and Forget
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Short-term plasticity (STP) is a mechanism that stores decaying memories
  in synapses of the cerebral cortex. In computing practice, STP has been used, but
  mostly in the niche of spiking neurons, even though theory predicts that it is the
  optimal solution to certain dynamic tasks. Here we present a new type of recurrent
  neural unit, the STP Neuron (STPN), which indeed turns out strikingly powerful.
  Its key mechanism is that synapses have a state, propagated through time by a self-recurrent
  connection-within-the-synapse. This formulation enables training the plasticity
  with backpropagation through time, resulting in a form of learning to learn and
  forget in the short term. The STPN outperforms all tested alternatives, i.e. RNNs,
  LSTMs, other models with fast weights, and differentiable plasticity. We confirm
  this in both supervised and reinforcement learning (RL), and in tasks such as Associative
  Retrieval, Maze Exploration, Atari video games, and MuJoCo robotics. Moreover, we
  calculate that, in neuromorphic or biological circuits, the STPN minimizes energy
  consumption across models, as it depresses individual synapses dynamically. Based
  on these, biological STP may have been a strong evolutionary attractor that maximizes
  both efficiency and computational power. The STPN now brings these neuromorphic
  advantages also to a broad spectrum of machine learning practice. Code is available
  in https://github.com/NeuromorphicComputing/stpn.
