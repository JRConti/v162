title: On the Hidden Biases of Policy Mirror Ascent in Continuous Action Spaces
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We focus on parameterized policy search for reinforcement learning over
  continuous action spaces. Typically, one assumes the score function associated with
  a policy is bounded, which {fails to hold even for Gaussian policies. } To properly
  address this issue, one must introduce an exploration tolerance parameter to quantify
  the region in which it is bounded. Doing so incurs a persistent bias that appears
  in the attenuation rate of the expected policy gradient norm, which is inversely
  proportional to the radius of the action space. To mitigate this hidden bias, heavy-tailed
  policy parameterizations may be used, which exhibit a bounded score function, but
  doing so can cause instability in algorithmic updates. To address these issues,
  in this work, we study the convergence of policy gradient algorithms under heavy-tailed
  parameterizations, which we propose to stabilize with a combination of mirror ascent-type
  updates and gradient tracking. Our main theoretical contribution is the establishment
  that this scheme converges with constant batch sizes, whereas prior works require
  these parameters to respectively shrink to null or grow to infinity. Experimentally,
  this scheme under a heavy-tailed policy parameterization yields improved reward
  accumulation across a variety of settings as compared with standard benchmarks.
