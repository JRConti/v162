title: 'You Only Cut Once: Boosting Data Augmentation with a Single Cut'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We present You Only Cut Once (YOCO) for performing data augmentations. YOCO
  cuts one image into two pieces and performs data augmentations individually within
  each piece. Applying YOCO improves the diversity of the augmentation per sample
  and encourages neural networks to recognize objects from partial information. YOCO
  enjoys the properties of parameter-free, easy usage, and boosting almost all augmentations
  for free. Thorough experiments are conducted to evaluate its effectiveness. We first
  demonstrate that YOCO can be seamlessly applied to varying data augmentations, neural
  network architectures, and brings performance gains on CIFAR and ImageNet classification
  tasks, sometimes surpassing conventional image-level augmentation by large margins.
  Moreover, we show YOCO benefits contrastive pre-training toward a more powerful
  representation that can be better transferred to multiple downstream tasks. Finally,
  we study a number of variants of YOCO and empirically analyze the performance for
  respective settings.
