title: Minimum Cost Intervention Design for Causal Effect Identification
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Pearlâ€™s do calculus is a complete axiomatic approach to learn the identifiable
  causal effects from observational data. When such an effect is not identifiable,
  it is necessary to perform a collection of often costly interventions in the system
  to learn the causal effect. In this work, we consider the problem of designing the
  collection of interventions with the minimum cost to identify the desired effect.
  First, we prove that this prob-em is NP-complete, and subsequently propose an algorithm
  that can either find the optimal solution or a logarithmic-factor approximation
  of it. This is done by establishing a connection between our problem and the minimum
  hitting set problem. Additionally, we propose several polynomial time heuristic
  algorithms to tackle the computational complexity of the problem. Although these
  algorithms could potentially stumble on sub-optimal solutions, our simulations show
  that they achieve small regrets on random graphs.
