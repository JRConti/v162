title: Fair Generalized Linear Models with a Convex Penalty
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Despite recent advances in algorithmic fairness, methodologies for achieving
  fairness with generalized linear models (GLMs) have yet to be explored in general,
  despite GLMs being widely used in practice. In this paper we introduce two fairness
  criteria for GLMs based on equalizing expected outcomes or log-likelihoods. We prove
  that for GLMs both criteria can be achieved via a convex penalty term based solely
  on the linear components of the GLM, thus permitting efficient optimization. We
  also derive theoretical properties for the resulting fair GLM estimator. To empirically
  demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed fair GLM, we compare it with other well-known
  fair prediction methods on an extensive set of benchmark datasets for binary classification
  and regression. In addition, we demonstrate that the fair GLM can generate fair
  predictions for a range of response variables, other than binary and continuous
  outcomes.
