abstract: Non-asymptotic analysis of quasi-Newton methods have received a lot of attention
  recently. In particular, several works have established a non-asymptotic superlinear
  rate of $$\mathcal{O}((1/\sqrt{t})^t)$$ for the (classic) BFGS method by exploiting
  the fact that its error of Newton direction approximation approaches zero. Moreover,
  a greedy variant of the BFGS method was recently proposed which accelerates the
  convergence of BFGS by directly approximating the Hessian matrix, instead of Newton
  direction, and achieves a fast local quadratic convergence rate. Alas, the local
  quadratic convergence of Greedy-BFGS requires way more updates compared to the number
  of iterations that BFGS requires for a local superlinear rate. This is due to the
  fact that in Greedy-BFGS the Hessian is directly approximated and the Newton direction
  approximation may not be as accurate as the one for BFGS. In this paper, we close
  this gap and present a novel BFGS method that has the best of two worlds. More precisely,
  it leverages the approximation ideas of both BFGS and Greedy-BFGS to properly approximate
  both the Newton direction and the Hessian matrix. Our theoretical results show that
  our method out-performs both BFGS and Greedy-BFGS in terms of convergence rate,
  while it reaches its quadratic convergence rate with fewer steps compared to Greedy-BFGS.
  Numerical experiments on various datasets also confirm our theoretical findings.
