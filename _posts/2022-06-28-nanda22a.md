title: Measuring Representational Robustness of Neural Networks Through Shared Invariances
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'A major challenge in studying robustness in deep learning is defining the
  set of “meaningless” perturbations to which a given Neural Network (NN) should be
  invariant. Most work on robustness implicitly uses a human as the reference model
  to define such perturbations. Our work offers a new view on robustness by using
  another reference NN to define the set of perturbations a given NN should be invariant
  to, thus generalizing the reliance on a reference “human NN” to any NN. This makes
  measuring robustness equivalent to measuring the extent to which two NNs share invariances.
  We propose a measure called \stir, which faithfully captures the extent to which
  two NNs share invariances. \stir re-purposes existing representation similarity
  measures to make them suitable for measuring shared invariances. Using our measure,
  we are able to gain insights about how shared invariances vary with changes in weight
  initialization, architecture, loss functions, and training dataset. Our implementation
  is available at: \url{https://github.com/nvedant07/STIR}.'
