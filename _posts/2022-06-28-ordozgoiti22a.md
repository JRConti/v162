title: 'Generalized Leverage Scores: Geometric Interpretation and Applications'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'In problems involving matrix computations, the concept of leverage has
  found a large number of applications. In particular, leverage scores, which relate
  the columns of a matrix to the subspaces spanned by its leading singular vectors,
  are helpful in revealing column subsets to approximately factorize a matrix with
  quality guarantees. As such, they provide a solid foundation for a variety of machine-learning
  methods. In this paper we extend the definition of leverage scores to relate the
  columns of a matrix to arbitrary subsets of singular vectors. We establish a precise
  connection between column and singular-vector subsets, by relating the concepts
  of leverage scores and principal angles between subspaces. We employ this result
  to design approximation algorithms with provable guarantees for two well-known problems:
  generalized column subset selection and sparse canonical correlation analysis. We
  run numerical experiments to provide further insight on the proposed methods. The
  novel bounds we derive improve our understanding of fundamental concepts in matrix
  approximations. In addition, our insights may serve as building blocks for further
  contributions.'
