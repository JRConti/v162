title: Dual Perspective of Label-Specific Feature Learning for Multi-Label Classification
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Label-specific features serve as an effective strategy to facilitate multi-label
  classification, which account for the distinct discriminative properties of each
  class label via tailoring its own features. Existing approaches implement this strategy
  in a quite straightforward way, i.e. finding the most pertinent and discriminative
  features for each class label and directly inducing classifiers on constructed label-specific
  features. In this paper, we propose a dual perspective for label-specific feature
  learning, where label-specific discriminative properties are considered by identifying
  each labelâ€™s own non-informative features and making the discrimination process
  immutable to variations of these features. To instantiate it, we present a perturbation-based
  approach DELA to provide classifiers with label-specific immutability on simultaneously
  identified non-informative features, which is optimized towards a probabilistically-relaxed
  expected risk minimization problem. Comprehensive experiments on 10 benchmark data
  sets show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art counterparts.
