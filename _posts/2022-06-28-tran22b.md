title: A Completely Tuning-Free and Robust Approach to Sparse Precision Matrix Estimation
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Despite the vast literature on sparse Gaussian graphical models, current
  methods either are asymptotically tuning-free (which still require fine-tuning in
  practice) or hinge on computationally expensive methods (e.g., cross-validation)
  to determine the proper level of regularization. We propose a completely tuning-free
  approach for estimating sparse Gaussian graphical models. Our method uses model-agnostic
  regularization parameters to estimate each column of the target precision matrix
  and enjoys several desirable properties. Computationally, our estimator can be computed
  efficiently by linear programming. Theoretically, the proposed estimator achieves
  minimax optimal convergence rates under various norms. We further propose a second-stage
  enhancement with non-convex penalties which possesses the strong oracle property.
  Through comprehensive numerical studies, our methods demonstrate favorable statistical
  performance. Remarkably, our methods exhibit strong robustness to the violation
  of the Gaussian assumption and significantly outperform competing methods in the
  heavy-tailed settings.
