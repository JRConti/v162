title: 'LeNSE: Learning To Navigate Subgraph Embeddings for Large-Scale Combinatorial
  Optimisation'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Combinatorial Optimisation problems arise in several application domains
  and are often formulated in terms of graphs. Many of these problems are NP-hard,
  but exact solutions are not always needed. Several heuristics have been developed
  to provide near-optimal solutions; however, they do not typically scale well with
  the size of the graph. We propose a low-complexity approach for identifying a (possibly
  much smaller) subgraph of the original graph where the heuristics can be run in
  reasonable time and with a high likelihood of finding a global near-optimal solution.
  The core component of our approach is LeNSE, a reinforcement learning algorithm
  that learns how to navigate the space of possible subgraphs using an Euclidean subgraph
  embedding as its map. To solve CO problems, LeNSE is provided with a discriminative
  embedding trained using any existing heuristics using only on a small portion of
  the original graph. When tested on three problems (vertex cover, max-cut and influence
  maximisation) using real graphs with up to $10$ million edges, LeNSE identifies
  small subgraphs yielding solutions comparable to those found by running the heuristics
  on the entire graph, but at a fraction of the total run time. Code for the experiments
  is available in the public GitHub repo at https://github.com/davidireland3/LeNSE.
