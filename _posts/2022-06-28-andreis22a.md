title: Set Based Stochastic Subsampling
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Deep models are designed to operate on huge volumes of high dimensional
  data such as images. In order to reduce the volume of data these models must process,
  we propose a set-based two-stage end-to-end neural subsampling model that is jointly
  optimized with an <em>arbitrary</em> downstream task network (e.g. classifier).
  In the first stage, we efficiently subsample <em>candidate elements</em> using conditionally
  independent Bernoulli random variables by capturing coarse grained global information
  using set encoding functions, followed by conditionally dependent autoregressive
  subsampling of the candidate elements using Categorical random variables by modeling
  pair-wise interactions using set attention networks in the second stage. We apply
  our method to feature and instance selection and show that it outperforms the relevant
  baselines under low subsampling rates on a variety of tasks including image classification,
  image reconstruction, function reconstruction and few-shot classification. Additionally,
  for nonparametric models such as Neural Processes that require to leverage the whole
  training data at inference time, we show that our method enhances the scalability
  of these models.
