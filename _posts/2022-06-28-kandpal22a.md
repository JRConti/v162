title: Deduplicating Training Data Mitigates Privacy Risks in Language Models
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Past work has shown that large language models are susceptible to privacy
  attacks, where adversaries generate sequences from a trained model and detect which
  sequences are memorized from the training set. In this work, we show that the success
  of these attacks is largely due to duplication in commonly used web-scraped training
  sets. We first show that the rate at which language models regenerate training sequences
  is superlinearly related to a sequenceâ€™s count in the training set. For instance,
  a sequence that is present 10 times in the training data is on average generated
  1000x more often than a sequence that is present only once. We next show that existing
  methods for detecting memorized sequences have near-chance accuracy on non-duplicated
  training sequences. Finally, we find that after applying methods to deduplicate
  training data, language models are considerably more secure against these types
  of privacy attacks. Taken together, our results motivate an increased focus on deduplication
  in privacy-sensitive applications and a reevaluation of the practicality of existing
  privacy attacks.
