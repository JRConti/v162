title: Coordinated Double Machine Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Double machine learning is a statistical method for leveraging complex black-box
  models to construct approximately unbiased treatment effect estimates given observational
  data with high-dimensional covariates, under the assumption of a partially linear
  model. The idea is to first fit on a subset of the samples two non-linear predictive
  models, one for the continuous outcome of interest and one for the observed treatment,
  and then to estimate a linear coefficient for the treatment using the remaining
  samples through a simple orthogonalized regression. While this methodology is flexible
  and can accommodate arbitrary predictive models, typically trained independently
  of one another, this paper argues that a carefully coordinated learning algorithm
  for deep neural networks may reduce the estimation bias. The improved empirical
  performance of the proposed method is demonstrated through numerical experiments
  on both simulated and real data.
