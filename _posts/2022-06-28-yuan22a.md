title: Robust Task Representations for Offline Meta-Reinforcement Learning via Contrastive
  Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We study offline meta-reinforcement learning, a practical reinforcement
  learning paradigm that learns from offline data to adapt to new tasks. The distribution
  of offline data is determined jointly by the behavior policy and the task. Existing
  offline meta-reinforcement learning algorithms cannot distinguish these factors,
  making task representations unstable to the change of behavior policies. To address
  this problem, we propose a contrastive learning framework for task representations
  that are robust to the distribution mismatch of behavior policies in training and
  test. We design a bi-level encoder structure, use mutual information maximization
  to formalize task representation learning, derive a contrastive learning objective,
  and introduce several approaches to approximate the true distribution of negative
  pairs. Experiments on a variety of offline meta-reinforcement learning benchmarks
  demonstrate the advantages of our method over prior methods, especially on the generalization
  to out-of-distribution behavior policies.
