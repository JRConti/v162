title: Least Squares Estimation using Sketched Data with Heteroskedastic Errors
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Researchers may perform regressions using a sketch of data of size m instead
  of the full sample of size n for a variety of reasons. This paper considers the
  case when the regression errors do not have constant variance and heteroskedasticity
  robust standard errors would normally be needed for test statistics to provide accurate
  inference. We show that estimates using data sketched by random projections will
  behave ’as if’ the errors were homoskedastic. Estimation by random sampling would
  not have this property. The result arises because the sketched estimates in the
  case of random projections can be expressed as degenerate U-statistics, and under
  certain conditions, these statistics are asymptotically normal with homoskedastic
  variance. We verify that the conditions hold not only in the case of least squares
  regression when the covariates are exogenous, but also in instrumental variables
  estimation when the covariates are endogenous. The result implies that inference
  can be simpler than the full sample case if the sketching scheme is appropriately
  chosen.
