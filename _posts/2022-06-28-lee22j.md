title: Why the Rich Get Richer? On the Balancedness of Random Partition Models
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Random partition models are widely used in Bayesian methods for various
  clustering tasks, such as mixture models, topic models, and community detection
  problems. While the number of clusters induced by random partition models has been
  studied extensively, another important model property regarding the balancedness
  of partition has been largely neglected. We formulate a framework to define and
  theoretically study the balancedness of exchangeable random partition models, by
  analyzing how a model assigns probabilities to partitions with different levels
  of balancedness. We demonstrate that the "rich-get-richer" characteristic of many
  existing popular random partition models is an inevitable consequence of two common
  assumptions: product-form exchangeability and projectivity. We propose a principled
  way to compare the balancedness of random partition models, which gives a better
  understanding of what model works better and what doesnâ€™t for different applications.
  We also introduce the "rich-get-poorer" random partition models and illustrate their
  application to entity resolution tasks.'
