title: Calibrated Learning to Defer with One-vs-All Classifiers
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The learning to defer (L2D) framework has the potential to make AI systems
  safer. For a given input, the system can defer the decision to a human if the human
  is more likely than the model to take the correct action. We study the calibration
  of L2D systems, investigating if the probabilities they output are sound. We find
  that Mozannar & Sontag’s (2020) multiclass framework is not calibrated with respect
  to expert correctness. Moreover, it is not even guaranteed to produce valid probabilities
  due to its parameterization being degenerate for this purpose. We propose an L2D
  system based on one-vs-all classifiers that is able to produce calibrated probabilities
  of expert correctness. Furthermore, our loss function is also a consistent surrogate
  for multiclass L2D, like Mozannar & Sontag’s (2020). Our experiments verify that
  not only is our system calibrated, but this benefit comes at no cost to accuracy.
  Our model’s accuracy is always comparable (and often superior) to Mozannar & Sontag’s
  (2020) model’s in tasks ranging from hate speech detection to galaxy classification
  to diagnosis of skin lesions.
