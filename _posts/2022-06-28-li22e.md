booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Gradient Descent Ascent (GDA) methods are the mainstream algorithms for
  minimax optimization in generative adversarial networks (GANs). Convergence properties
  of GDA have drawn significant interest in the recent literature. Specifically, for
  $\min_{x} \max_{y} f(x;y)$ where $f$ is strongly-concave in $y$ and possibly nonconvex
  in $x$, (Lin et al., 2020) proved the convergence of GDA with a stepsize ratio $\eta_y/\eta_x=\Theta(\kappa^2)$
  where $\eta_x$ and $\eta_y$ are the stepsizes for $x$ and $y$ and $\kappa$ is the
  condition number for $y$. While this stepsize ratio suggests a slow training of
  the min player, practical GAN algorithms typically adopt similar stepsizes for both
  variables, indicating a wide gap between theoretical and empirical results. In this
  paper, we aim to bridge this gap by analyzing the <em>local convergence</em> of
  general <em>nonconvex-nonconcave</em> minimax problems. We demonstrate that a stepsize
  ratio of $\Theta(\kappa)$ is necessary and sufficient for local convergence of GDA
  to a Stackelberg Equilibrium, where $\kappa$ is the local condition number for $y$.
  We prove a nearly tight convergence rate with a matching lower bound. We further
  extend the convergence guarantees to stochastic GDA and extra-gradient methods (EG).
  Finally, we conduct several numerical experiments to support our theoretical findings.
