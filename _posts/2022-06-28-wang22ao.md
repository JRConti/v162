title: Individual Reward Assisted Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In many real-world multi-agent systems, the sparsity of team rewards often
  makes it difficult for an algorithm to successfully learn a cooperative team policy.
  At present, the common way for solving this problem is to design some dense individual
  rewards for the agents to guide the cooperation. However, most existing works utilize
  individual rewards in ways that do not always promote teamwork and sometimes are
  even counterproductive. In this paper, we propose <em>Individual Reward Assisted
  Team Policy Learning</em> (IRAT), which learns two policies for each agent from
  the dense individual reward and the sparse team reward with discrepancy constraints
  for updating the two policies mutually. Experimental results in different scenarios,
  such as the Multi-Agent Particle Environment and the Google Research Football Environment,
  show that IRAT significantly outperforms the baseline methods and can greatly promote
  team policy learning without deviating from the original team objective, even when
  the individual rewards are misleading or conflict with the team rewards.
