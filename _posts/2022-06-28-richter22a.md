title: Robust SDE-Based Variational Formulations for Solving Linear PDEs via Deep
  Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The combination of Monte Carlo methods and deep learning has recently led
  to efficient algorithms for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) in high
  dimensions. Related learning problems are often stated as variational formulations
  based on associated stochastic differential equations (SDEs), which allow the minimization
  of corresponding losses using gradient-based optimization methods. In respective
  numerical implementations it is therefore crucial to rely on adequate gradient estimators
  that exhibit low variance in order to reach convergence accurately and swiftly.
  In this article, we rigorously investigate corresponding numerical aspects that
  appear in the context of linear Kolmogorov PDEs. In particular, we systematically
  compare existing deep learning approaches and provide theoretical explanations for
  their performances. Subsequently, we suggest novel methods that can be shown to
  be more robust both theoretically and numerically, leading to substantial performance
  improvements.
