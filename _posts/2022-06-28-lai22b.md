title: 'Smoothed Adaptive Weighting for Imbalanced Semi-Supervised Learning: Improve
  Reliability Against Unknown Distribution Data'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Despite recent promising results on semi-supervised learning (SSL), data
  imbalance, particularly in the unlabeled dataset, could significantly impact the
  training performance of a SSL algorithm if there is a mismatch between the expected
  and actual class distributions. The efforts on how to construct a robust SSL framework
  that can effectively learn from datasets with unknown distributions remain limited.
  We first investigate the feasibility of adding weights to the consistency loss and
  then we verify the necessity of smoothed weighting schemes. Based on this study,
  we propose a self-adaptive algorithm, named Smoothed Adaptive Weighting (SAW). SAW
  is designed to enhance the robustness of SSL by estimating the learning difficulty
  of each class and synthesizing the weights in the consistency loss based on such
  estimation. We show that SAW can complement recent consistency-based SSL algorithms
  and improve their reliability on various datasets including three standard datasets
  and one gigapixel medical imaging application without making any assumptions about
  the distribution of the unlabeled set.
