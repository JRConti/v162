title: Towards Coherent and Consistent Use of Entities in Narrative Generation
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Large pre-trained language models (LMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities
  in generating long, fluent text; however, there is little to no analysis on their
  ability to maintain entity coherence and consistency. In this work, we focus on
  the end task of narrative generation and systematically analyse the long-range entity
  coherence and consistency in generated stories. First, we propose a set of automatic
  metrics for measuring model performance in terms of entity usage. Given these metrics,
  we quantify the limitations of current LMs. Next, we propose augmenting a pre-trained
  LM with a dynamic entity memory in an end-to-end manner by using an auxiliary entity-related
  loss for guiding the reads and writes to the memory. We demonstrate that the dynamic
  entity memory increases entity coherence according to both automatic and human judgment
  and helps preserving entity-related information especially in settings with a limited
  context window. Finally, we also validate that our automatic metrics are correlated
  with human ratings and serve as a good indicator of the quality of generated stories.
