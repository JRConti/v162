title: Partial Counterfactual Identification from Observational and Experimental Data
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: This paper investigates the problem of bounding counterfactual queries from
  an arbitrary collection of observational and experimental distributions and qualitative
  knowledge about the underlying data-generating model represented in the form of
  a causal diagram. We show that all counterfactual distributions in an arbitrary
  structural causal model (SCM) with discrete observed domains could be generated
  by a canonical family of SCMs with the same causal diagram where unobserved (exogenous)
  variables are also discrete, taking values in finite domains. Utilizing the canonical
  SCMs, we translate the problem of bounding counterfactuals into that of polynomial
  programming whose solution provides optimal bounds for the counterfactual query.
  Solving such polynomial programs is in general computationally expensive. We then
  develop effective Monte Carlo algorithms to approximate optimal bounds from a combination
  of observational and experimental data. Our algorithms are validated extensively
  on synthetic and real-world datasets.
