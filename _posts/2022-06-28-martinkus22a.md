title: 'SPECTRE: Spectral Conditioning Helps to Overcome the Expressivity Limits of
  One-shot Graph Generators'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We approach the graph generation problem from a spectral perspective by
  first generating the dominant parts of the graph Laplacian spectrum and then building
  a graph matching these eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Spectral conditioning allows
  for direct modeling of the global and local graph structure and helps to overcome
  the expressivity and mode collapse issues of one-shot graph generators. Our novel
  GAN, called SPECTRE, enables the one-shot generation of much larger graphs than
  previously possible with one-shot models. SPECTRE outperforms state-of-the-art deep
  autoregressive generators in terms of modeling fidelity, while also avoiding expensive
  sequential generation and dependence on node ordering. A case in point, in sizable
  synthetic and real-world graphs SPECTRE achieves a 4-to-170 fold improvement over
  the best competitor that does not overfit and is 23-to-30 times faster than autoregressive
  generators.
