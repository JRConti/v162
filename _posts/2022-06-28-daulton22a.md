title: Robust Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization Under Input Noise
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a sample-efficient approach for tuning design
  parameters to optimize expensive-to-evaluate, black-box performance metrics. In
  many manufacturing processes, the design parameters are subject to random input
  noise, resulting in a product that is often less performant than expected. Although
  BO methods have been proposed for optimizing a single objective under input noise,
  no existing method addresses the practical scenario where there are multiple objectives
  that are sensitive to input perturbations. In this work, we propose the first multi-objective
  BO method that is robust to input noise. We formalize our goal as optimizing the
  multivariate value-at-risk (MVaR), a risk measure of the uncertain objectives. Since
  directly optimizing MVaR is computationally infeasible in many settings, we propose
  a scalable, theoretically-grounded approach for optimizing MVaR using random scalarizations.
  Empirically, we find that our approach significantly outperforms alternative methods
  and efficiently identifies optimal robust designs that will satisfy specifications
  across multiple metrics with high probability.
