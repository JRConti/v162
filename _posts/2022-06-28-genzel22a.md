title: Near-Exact Recovery for Tomographic Inverse Problems via Deep Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'This work is concerned with the following fundamental question in scientific
  machine learning: Can deep-learning-based methods solve noise-free inverse problems
  to near-perfect accuracy? Positive evidence is provided for the first time, focusing
  on a prototypical computed tomography (CT) setup. We demonstrate that an iterative
  end-to-end network scheme enables reconstructions close to numerical precision,
  comparable to classical compressed sensing strategies. Our results build on our
  winning submission to the recent AAPM DL-Sparse-View CT Challenge. Its goal was
  to identify the state-of-the-art in solving the sparse-view CT inverse problem with
  data-driven techniques. A specific difficulty of the challenge setup was that the
  precise forward model remained unknown to the participants. Therefore, a key feature
  of our approach was to initially estimate the unknown fanbeam geometry in a data-driven
  calibration step. Apart from an in-depth analysis of our methodology, we also demonstrate
  its state-of-the-art performance on the open-access real-world dataset LoDoPaB CT.'
