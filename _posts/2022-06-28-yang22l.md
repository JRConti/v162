abstract: By integrating domain knowledge with labeled samples, informed machine learning
  has been emerging to improve the learning performance for a wide range of applications.
  Nonetheless, rigorous understanding of the role of injected domain knowledge has
  been under-explored. In this paper, we consider an informed deep neural network
  (DNN) with over-parameterization and domain knowledge integrated into its training
  objective function, and study how and why domain knowledge benefits the performance.
  Concretely, we quantitatively demonstrate the two benefits of domain knowledge in
  informed learning {—} regularizing the label-based supervision and supplementing
  the labeled samples {—} and reveal the trade-off between label and knowledge imperfectness
  in the bound of the population risk. Based on the theoretical analysis, we propose
  a generalized informed training objective to better exploit the benefits of knowledge
  and balance the label and knowledge imperfectness, which is validated by the population
  risk bound. Our analysis on sampling complexity sheds lights on how to choose the
  hyper-parameters for informed learning, and further justifies the advantages of
  knowledge informed learning.
