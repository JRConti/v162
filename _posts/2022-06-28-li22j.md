title: Neural Inverse Transform Sampler
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Any explicit functional representation $f$ of a density is hampered by
  two main obstacles when we wish to use it as a generative model: designing $f$ so
  that sampling is fast, and estimating $Z = \int f$ so that $Z^{-1}f$ integrates
  to 1. This becomes increasingly complicated as $f$ itself becomes complicated. In
  this paper, we show that when modeling one-dimensional conditional densities with
  a neural network, $Z$ can be exactly and efficiently computed by letting the network
  represent the cumulative distribution function of a target density, and applying
  a generalized fundamental theorem of calculus. We also derive a fast algorithm for
  sampling from the resulting representation by the inverse transform method. By extending
  these principles to higher dimensions, we introduce the \textbf{Neural Inverse Transform
  Sampler (NITS)}, a novel deep learning framework for modeling and sampling from
  general, multidimensional, compactly-supported probability densities. NITS is a
  highly expressive density estimator that boasts end-to-end differentiability, fast
  sampling, and exact and cheap likelihood evaluation. We demonstrate the applicability
  of NITS by applying it to realistic, high-dimensional density estimation tasks:
  likelihood-based generative modeling on the CIFAR-10 dataset, and density estimation
  on the UCI suite of benchmark datasets, where NITS produces compelling results rivaling
  or surpassing the state of the art.'
