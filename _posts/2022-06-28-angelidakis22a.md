title: Fair and Fast k-Center Clustering for Data Summarization
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We consider two key issues faced by many clustering methods when used for
  data summarization, namely (a) an unfair representation of "demographic groups‚Äù
  and (b) distorted summarizations, where data points in the summary represent subsets
  of the original data of vastly different sizes. Previous work made important steps
  towards handling separately each of these two issues in the context of the fundamental
  k-Center clustering objective through the study of fast algorithms for natural models
  that address them. We show that it is possible to effectively address both (a) and
  (b) simultaneously by presenting a clustering procedure that works for a canonical
  combined model and (i) is fast, both in theory and practice, (ii) exhibits a worst-case
  constant-factor guarantee, and (iii) gives promising computational results showing
  that there can be significant benefits in addressing both issues together instead
  of sequentially.
