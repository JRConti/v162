title: Rethinking Fano’s Inequality in Ensemble Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We propose a fundamental theory on ensemble learning that evaluates a given
  ensemble system by a well-grounded set of metrics. Previous studies used a variant
  of Fano’s inequality of information theory and derived a lower bound of the classification
  error rate on the basis of the accuracy and diversity of models. We revisit the
  original Fano’s inequality and argue that the studies did not take into account
  the information lost when multiple model predictions are combined into a final prediction.
  To address this issue, we generalize the previous theory to incorporate the information
  loss. Further, we empirically validate and demonstrate the proposed theory through
  extensive experiments on actual systems. The theory reveals the strengths and weaknesses
  of systems on each metric, which will push the theoretical understanding of ensemble
  learning and give us insights into designing systems.
