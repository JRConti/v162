title: Importance Weighted Kernel Bayes’ Rule
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We study a nonparametric approach to Bayesian computation via feature means,
  where the expectation of prior features is updated to yield expected posterior features,
  based on regression from kernel or neural net features of the observations. All
  quantities involved in the Bayesian update are learned from observed data, making
  the method entirely model-free. The resulting algorithm is a novel instance of a
  kernel Bayes’ rule (KBR). Our approach is based on importance weighting, which results
  in superior numerical stability to the existing approach to KBR, which requires
  operator inversion. We show the convergence of the estimator using a novel consistency
  analysis on the importance weighting estimator in the infinity norm. We evaluate
  our KBR on challenging synthetic benchmarks, including a filtering problem with
  a state-space model involving high dimensional image observations. The proposed
  method yields uniformly better empirical performance than the existing KBR, and
  competitive performance with other competing methods. We evaluate our KBR on challenging
