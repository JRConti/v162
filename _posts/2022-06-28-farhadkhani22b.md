title: An Equivalence Between Data Poisoning and Byzantine Gradient Attacks
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: To study the resilience of distributed learning, the “Byzantine" literature
  considers a strong threat model where workers can report arbitrary gradients to
  the parameter server. Whereas this model helped obtain several fundamental results,
  it has sometimes been considered unrealistic, when the workers are mostly trustworthy
  machines. In this paper, we show a surprising equivalence between this model and
  data poisoning, a threat considered much more realistic. More specifically, we prove
  that every gradient attack can be reduced to data poisoning, in any personalized
  federated learning system with PAC guarantees (which we show are both desirable
  and realistic). This equivalence makes it possible to obtain new impossibility results
  on the resilience of <em>any</em> “robust” learning algorithm to data poisoning
  in highly heterogeneous applications, as corollaries of existing impossibility theorems
  on Byzantine machine learning. Moreover, using our equivalence, we derive a practical
  attack that we show (theoretically and empirically) can be very effective against
  classical personalized federated learning models.
