title: One-Pass Algorithms for MAP Inference of Nonsymmetric Determinantal Point Processes
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In this paper, we initiate the study of one-pass algorithms for solving
  the maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) inference problem for Non-symmetric Determinantal
  Point Processes (NDPPs). In particular, we formulate streaming and online versions
  of the problem and provide one-pass algorithms for solving these problems. In our
  streaming setting, data points arrive in an arbitrary order and the algorithms are
  constrained to use a single-pass over the data as well as sub-linear memory, and
  only need to output a valid solution at the end of the stream. Our online setting
  has an additional requirement of maintaining a valid solution at any point in time.
  We design new one-pass algorithms for these problems and show that they perform
  comparably to (or even better than) the offline greedy algorithm while using substantially
  lower memory.
