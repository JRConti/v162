title: Content Addressable Memory Without Catastrophic Forgetting by Heteroassociation
  with a Fixed Scaffold
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Content-addressable memory (CAM) networks, so-called because stored items
  can be recalled by partial or corrupted versions of the items, exhibit near-perfect
  recall of a small number of information-dense patterns below capacity and a ’memory
  cliff’ beyond, such that inserting a single additional pattern results in catastrophic
  loss of all stored patterns. We propose a novel CAM architecture, Memory Scaffold
  with Heteroassociation (MESH), that factorizes the problems of internal attractor
  dynamics and association with external content to generate a CAM continuum without
  a memory cliff: Small numbers of patterns are stored with complete information recovery
  matching standard CAMs, while inserting more patterns still results in partial recall
  of every pattern, with a graceful trade-off between pattern number and pattern richness.
  Motivated by the architecture of the Entorhinal-Hippocampal memory circuit in the
  brain, MESH is a tripartite architecture with pairwise interactions that uses a
  predetermined set of internally stabilized states together with heteroassociation
  between the internal states and arbitrary external patterns. We show analytically
  and experimentally that for any number of stored patterns, MESH nearly saturates
  the total information bound (given by the number of synapses) for CAM networks,
  outperforming all existing CAM models.'
