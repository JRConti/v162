title: Correlated Quantization for Distributed Mean Estimation and Optimization
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We study the problem of distributed mean estimation and optimization under
  communication constraints. We propose a correlated quantization protocol whose error
  guarantee depends on the deviation of data points instead of their absolute range.
  The design doesnâ€™t need any prior knowledge on the concentration property of the
  dataset, which is required to get such dependence in previous works. We show that
  applying the proposed protocol as a sub-routine in distributed optimization algorithms
  leads to better convergence rates. We also prove the optimality of our protocol
  under mild assumptions. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms
  existing mean estimation protocols on a diverse set of tasks.
