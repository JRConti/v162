title: 'BabelTower: Learning to Auto-parallelized Program Translation'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: GPUs have become the dominant computing platforms for many applications,
  while programming GPUs with the widely-used CUDA parallel programming model is difficult.
  As sequential C code is relatively easy to obtain either from legacy repositories
  or by manual implementation, automatically translating C to its parallel CUDA counterpart
  is promising to relieve the burden of GPU programming. However, because of huge
  differences between the sequential C and the parallel CUDA programming model, existing
  approaches fail to conduct the challenging auto-parallelized program translation.
  In this paper, we propose a learning-based framework, i.e., BabelTower, to address
  this problem. We first create a large-scale dataset consisting of compute-intensive
  function-level monolingual corpora. We further propose using back-translation with
  a discriminative reranker to cope with unpaired corpora and parallel semantic conversion.
  Experimental results show that BabelTower outperforms state-of-the-art by 1.79,
  6.09, and 9.39 in terms of BLEU, CodeBLEU, and specifically designed ParaBLEU, respectively.
  The CUDA code generated by BabelTower attains a speedup of up to 347x over the sequential
  C code, and the developer productivity is improved by at most 3.8x.
