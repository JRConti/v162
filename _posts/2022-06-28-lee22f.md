title: 'Statistical inference with implicit SGD: proximal Robbins-Monro vs. Polyak-Ruppert'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The implicit stochastic gradient descent (ISGD), a proximal version of SGD,
  is gaining interest in the literature due to its stability over (explicit) SGD.
  In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the two modes of ISGD for smooth
  convex functions, namely proximal Robbins-Monro (proxRM) and proximal Poylak-Ruppert
  (proxPR) procedures, for their use in statistical inference on model parameters.
  Specifically, we derive non-asymptotic point estimation error bounds of both proxRM
  and proxPR iterates and their limiting distributions, and propose on-line estimators
  of their asymptotic covariance matrices that require only a single run of ISGD.
  The latter estimators are used to construct valid confidence intervals for the model
  parameters. Our analysis is free of the generalized linear model assumption that
  has limited the preceding analyses, and employs feasible procedures. Our on-line
  covariance matrix estimators appear to be the first of this kind in the ISGD literature.
