title: Universal Joint Approximation of Manifolds and Densities by Simple Injective
  Flows
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'We study approximation of probability measures supported on n-dimensional
  manifolds embedded in R^m by injective flowsâ€”neural networks composed of invertible
  flows and injective layers. We show that in general, injective flows between R^n
  and R^m universally approximate measures supported on images of extendable embeddings,
  which are a subset of standard embeddings: when the embedding dimension m is small,
  topological obstructions may preclude certain manifolds as admissible targets. When
  the embedding dimension is sufficiently large, m >= 3n+1, we use an argument from
  algebraic topology known as the clean trick to prove that the topological obstructions
  vanish and injective flows universally approximate any differentiable embedding.
  Along the way we show that the studied injective flows admit efficient projections
  on the range, and that their optimality can be established "in reverse," resolving
  a conjecture made in Brehmer & Cranmer 2020.'
