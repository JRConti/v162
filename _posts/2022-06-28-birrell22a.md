title: Structure-preserving GANs
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs), a class of distribution-learning
  methods based on a two-player game between a generator and a discriminator, can
  generally be formulated as a minmax problem based on the variational representation
  of a divergence between the unknown and the generated distributions. We introduce
  structure-preserving GANs as a data-efficient framework for learning distributions
  with additional structure such as group symmetry, by developing new variational
  representations for divergences. Our theory shows that we can reduce the discriminator
  space to its projection on the invariant discriminator space, using the conditional
  expectation with respect to the sigma-algebra associated to the underlying structure.
  In addition, we prove that the discriminator space reduction must be accompanied
  by a careful design of structured generators, as flawed designs may easily lead
  to a catastrophic “mode collapse” of the learned distribution. We contextualize
  our framework by building symmetry-preserving GANs for distributions with intrinsic
  group symmetry, and demonstrate that both players, namely the equivariant generator
  and invariant discriminator, play important but distinct roles in the learning process.
  Empirical experiments and ablation studies across a broad range of data sets, including
  real-world medical imaging, validate our theory, and show our proposed methods achieve
  significantly improved sample fidelity and diversity—almost an order of magnitude
  measured in Frechet Inception Distance—especially in the small data regime.
