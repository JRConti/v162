title: Topology-Aware Network Pruning using Multi-stage Graph Embedding and Reinforcement
  Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Model compression is an essential technique for deploying deep neural networks
  (DNNs) on power and memory-constrained resources. However, existing model-compression
  methods often rely on human expertise and focus on parametersâ€™ local importance,
  ignoring the rich topology information within DNNs. In this paper, we propose a
  novel multi-stage graph embedding technique based on graph neural networks (GNNs)
  to identify DNN topologies and use reinforcement learning (RL) to find a suitable
  compression policy. We performed resource-constrained (i.e., FLOPs) channel pruning
  and compared our approach with state-of-the-art model compression methods. We evaluated
  our method on various models from typical to mobile-friendly networks, such as ResNet
  family, VGG-16, MobileNet-v1/v2, and ShuffleNet. Results show that our method can
  achieve higher compression ratios with a minimal fine-tuning cost yet yields outstanding
  and competitive performance.
