title: 'Branchformer: Parallel MLP-Attention Architectures to Capture Local and Global
  Context for Speech Recognition and Understanding'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Conformer has proven to be effective in many speech processing tasks. It
  combines the benefits of extracting local dependencies using convolutions and global
  dependencies using self-attention. Inspired by this, we propose a more flexible,
  interpretable and customizable encoder alternative, Branchformer, with parallel
  branches for modeling various ranged dependencies in end-to-end speech processing.
  In each encoder layer, one branch employs self-attention or its variant to capture
  long-range dependencies, while the other branch utilizes an MLP module with convolutional
  gating (cgMLP) to extract local relationships. We conduct experiments on several
  speech recognition and spoken language understanding benchmarks. Results show that
  our model outperforms both Transformer and cgMLP. It also matches with or outperforms
  state-of-the-art results achieved by Conformer. Furthermore, we show various strategies
  to reduce computation thanks to the two-branch architecture, including the ability
  to have variable inference complexity in a single trained model. The weights learned
  for merging branches indicate how local and global dependencies are utilized in
  different layers, which benefits model designing.
