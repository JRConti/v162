title: The Role of Deconfounding in Meta-learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Meta-learning has emerged as a potent paradigm for quick learning of few-shot
  tasks, by leveraging the meta-knowledge learned from meta-training tasks. Well-generalized
  meta-knowledge that facilitates fast adaptation in each task is preferred; however,
  recent evidence suggests the undesirable memorization effect where the meta-knowledge
  simply memorizing all meta-training tasks discourages task-specific adaptation and
  poorly generalizes. There have been several solutions to mitigating the effect,
  including both regularizer-based and augmentation-based methods, while a systematic
  understanding of these methods in a single framework is still lacking. In this paper,
  we offer a novel causal perspective of meta-learning. Through the lens of causality,
  we conclude the universal label space as a confounder to be the causing factor of
  memorization and frame the two lines of prevailing methods as different deconfounder
  approaches. Remarkably, derived from the causal inference principle of front-door
  adjustment, we propose two frustratingly easy but effective deconfounder algorithms,
  i.e., sampling multiple versions of the meta-knowledge via Dropout and grouping
  the meta-knowledge into multiple bins. The proposed causal perspective not only
  brings in the two deconfounder algorithms that surpass previous works in four benchmark
  datasets towards combating memorization, but also opens a promising direction for
  meta-learning.
