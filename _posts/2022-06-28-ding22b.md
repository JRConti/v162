title: 'Independent Policy Gradient for Large-Scale Markov Potential Games: Sharper
  Rates, Function Approximation, and Game-Agnostic Convergence'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We examine global non-asymptotic convergence properties of policy gradient
  methods for multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) problems in Markov potential
  games (MPGs). To learn a Nash equilibrium of an MPG in which the size of state space
  and/or the number of players can be very large, we propose new independent policy
  gradient algorithms that are run by all players in tandem. When there is no uncertainty
  in the gradient evaluation, we show that our algorithm finds an $\epsilon$-Nash
  equilibrium with $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ iteration complexity which does not explicitly
  depend on the state space size. When the exact gradient is not available, we establish
  $O(1/\epsilon^5)$ sample complexity bound in a potentially infinitely large state
  space for a sample-based algorithm that utilizes function approximation. Moreover,
  we identify a class of independent policy gradient algorithms that enjoy convergence
  for both zero-sum Markov games and Markov cooperative games with the players that
  are oblivious to the types of games being played. Finally, we provide computational
  experiments to corroborate the merits and the effectiveness of our theoretical developments.
