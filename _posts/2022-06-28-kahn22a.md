title: 'Flashlight: Enabling Innovation in Tools for Machine Learning'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: As the computational requirements for machine learning systems and the size
  and complexity of machine learning frameworks increases, essential framework innovation
  has become challenging. While computational needs have driven recent compiler, networking,
  and hardware advancements, utilization of those advancements by machine learning
  tools is occurring at a slower pace. This is in part due to the difficulties involved
  in prototyping new computational paradigms with existing frameworks. Large frameworks
  prioritize machine learning researchers and practitioners as end users and pay comparatively
  little attention to systems researchers who can push frameworks forward â€” we argue
  that both are equally important stakeholders. We introduce Flashlight, an open-source
  library built to spur innovation in machine learning tools and systems by prioritizing
  open, modular, customizable internals and state-of-the-art, research-ready models
  and training setups across a variety of domains. Flashlight allows systems researchers
  to rapidly prototype and experiment with novel ideas in machine learning computation
  and has low overhead, competing with and often outperforming other popular machine
  learning frameworks. We see Flashlight as a tool enabling research that can benefit
  widely used libraries downstream and bring machine learning and systems researchers
  closer together.
