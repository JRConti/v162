booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'We present a conceptual framework, <em>datamodeling</em>, for analyzing
  the behavior of a model class in terms of the training data. For any fixed “target”
  example $x$, training set $S$, and learning algorithm, a <em>datamodel</em> is a
  parameterized function $2^S \to \mathbb{R}$ that for any subset of $S’ \subset S$—using
  only information about which examples of $S$ are contained in $S’$—predicts the
  outcome of training a model on $S’$ and evaluating on $x$. Despite the complexity
  of the underlying process being approximated (e.g. end-to-end training and evaluation
  of deep neural networks), we show that even simple <em>linear</em> datamodels successfully
  predict model outputs. We then demonstrate that datamodels give rise to a variety
  of applications, such as: accurately predicting the effect of dataset counterfactuals;
  identifying brittle predictions; finding semantically similar examples; quantifying
  train-test leakage; and embedding data into a well-behaved and feature-rich representation
  space.'
