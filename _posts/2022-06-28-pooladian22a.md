title: 'Debiaser Beware: Pitfalls of Centering Regularized Transport Maps'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Estimating optimal transport (OT) maps (a.k.a. Monge maps) between two measures
  P and Q is a problem fraught with computational and statistical challenges. A promising
  approach lies in using the dual potential functions obtained when solving an entropy-regularized
  OT problem between samples P_n and Q_n, which can be used to recover an approximately
  optimal map. The negentropy penalization in that scheme introduces, however, an
  estimation bias that grows with the regularization strength. A well-known remedy
  to debias such estimates, which has gained wide popularity among practitioners of
  regularized OT, is to center them, by subtracting auxiliary problems involving P_n
  and itself, as well as Q_n and itself. We do prove that, under favorable conditions
  on P and Q, debiasing can yield better approximations to the Monge map. However,
  and perhaps surprisingly, we present a few cases in which debiasing is provably
  detrimental in a statistical sense, notably when the regularization strength is
  large or the number of samples is small. These claims are validated experimentally
  on synthetic and real datasets, and should reopen the debate on whether debiasing
  is needed when using entropic OT.
