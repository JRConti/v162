title: Scalable Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms for Mean Field Games
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Mean Field Games (MFGs) have been introduced to efficiently approximate
  games with very large populations of strategic agents. Recently, the question of
  learning equilibria in MFGs has gained momentum, particularly using model-free reinforcement
  learning (RL) methods. One limiting factor to further scale up using RL is that
  existing algorithms to solve MFGs require the mixing of approximated quantities
  such as strategies or $q$-values. This is far from being trivial in the case of
  non-linear function approximation that enjoy good generalization properties, <em>e.g.</em>
  neural networks. We propose two methods to address this shortcoming. The first one
  learns a mixed strategy from distillation of historical data into a neural network
  and is applied to the Fictitious Play algorithm. The second one is an online mixing
  method based on regularization that does not require memorizing historical data
  or previous estimates. It is used to extend Online Mirror Descent. We demonstrate
  numerically that these methods efficiently enable the use of Deep RL algorithms
  to solve various MFGs. In addition, we show that these methods outperform SotA baselines
  from the literature.
