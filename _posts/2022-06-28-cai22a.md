title: Near-Optimal Algorithms for Autonomous Exploration and Multi-Goal Stochastic
  Shortest Path
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'We revisit the incremental autonomous exploration problem proposed by Lim
  and Auer (2012). In this setting, the agent aims to learn a set of near-optimal
  goal-conditioned policies to reach the $L$-controllable states: states that are
  incrementally reachable from an initial state $s_0$ within $L$ steps in expectation.
  We introduce a new algorithm with stronger sample complexity bounds than existing
  ones. Furthermore, we also prove the first lower bound for the autonomous exploration
  problem. In particular, the lower bound implies that our proposed algorithm, Value-Aware
  Autonomous Exploration, is nearly minimax-optimal when the number of $L$-controllable
  states grows polynomially with respect to $L$. Key in our algorithm design is a
  connection between autonomous exploration and multi-goal stochastic shortest path,
  a new problem that naturally generalizes the classical stochastic shortest path
  problem. This new problem and its connection to autonomous exploration can be of
  independent interest.'
