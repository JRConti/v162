title: Zero-shot AutoML with Pretrained Models
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Given a new dataset D and a low compute budget, how should we choose a pre-trained
  model to fine-tune to D, and set the fine-tuning hyperparameters without risking
  overfitting, particularly if D is small? Here, we extend automated machine learning
  (AutoML) to best make these choices. Our domain-independent meta-learning approach
  learns a zero-shot surrogate model which, at test time, allows to select the right
  deep learning (DL) pipeline (including the pre-trained model and fine-tuning hyperparameters)
  for a new dataset D given only trivial meta-features describing D such as image
  resolution or the number of classes. To train this zero-shot model, we collect performance
  data for many DL pipelines on a large collection of datasets and meta-train on this
  data to minimize a pairwise ranking objective. We evaluate our approach under the
  strict time limit of the vision track of the ChaLearn AutoDL challenge benchmark,
  clearly outperforming all challenge contenders.
