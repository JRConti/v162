title: 'Online Nonsubmodular Minimization with Delayed Costs: From Full Information
  to Bandit Feedback'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Motivated by applications to online learning in sparse estimation and Bayesian
  optimization, we consider the problem of online unconstrained nonsubmodular minimization
  with delayed costs in both full information and bandit feedback settings. In contrast
  to previous works on online unconstrained submodular minimization, we focus on a
  class of nonsubmodular functions with special structure, and prove regret guarantees
  for several variants of the online and approximate online bandit gradient descent
  algorithms in static and delayed scenarios. We derive bounds for the agent’s regret
  in the full information and bandit feedback setting, even if the delay between choosing
  a decision and receiving the incurred cost is unbounded. Key to our approach is
  the notion of $(\alpha, \beta)$-regret and the extension of the generic convex relaxation
  model from \citet{El-2020-Optimal}, the analysis of which is of independent interest.
  We conduct and showcase several simulation studies to demonstrate the efficacy of
  our algorithms.
