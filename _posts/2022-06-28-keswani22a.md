title: A Convergent and Dimension-Independent Min-Max Optimization Algorithm
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We study a variant of a recently introduced min-max optimization framework
  where the max-player is constrained to update its parameters in a greedy manner
  until it reaches a first-order stationary point. Our equilibrium definition for
  this framework depends on a proposal distribution which the min-player uses to choose
  directions in which to update its parameters. We show that, given a smooth and bounded
  nonconvex-nonconcave objective function, access to any proposal distribution for
  the min-playerâ€™s updates, and stochastic gradient oracle for the max-player, our
  algorithm converges to the aforementioned approximate local equilibrium in a number
  of iterations that does not depend on the dimension. The equilibrium point found
  by our algorithm depends on the proposal distribution, and when applying our algorithm
  to train GANs we choose the proposal distribution to be a distribution of stochastic
  gradients. We empirically evaluate our algorithm on challenging nonconvex-nonconcave
  test-functions and loss functions arising in GAN training. Our algorithm converges
  on these test functions and, when used to train GANs, trains stably on synthetic
  and real-world datasets and avoids mode collapse.
