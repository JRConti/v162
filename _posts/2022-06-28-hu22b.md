title: 'Neuron Dependency Graphs: A Causal Abstraction of Neural Networks'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We discover that neural networks exhibit approximate logical dependencies
  among neurons, and we introduce Neuron Dependency Graphs (NDG) that extract and
  present them as directed graphs. In an NDG, each node corresponds to the boolean
  activation value of a neuron, and each edge models an approximate logical implication
  from one node to another. We show that the logical dependencies extracted from the
  training dataset generalize well to the test set. In addition to providing symbolic
  explanations to the neural networkâ€™s internal structure, NDGs can represent a Structural
  Causal Model. We empirically show that an NDG is a causal abstraction of the corresponding
  neural network that "unfolds" the same way under causal interventions using the
  theory by Geiger et al. (2021). Code is available at https://github.com/phimachine/ndg.
