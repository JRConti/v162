  Regression'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Bayesian additive regression trees (BART; Chipman et al., 2010) have gained
  great popularity as a flexible nonparametric function estimation and modeling tool.
  Nearly all existing BART models rely on decision tree weak learners with axis-parallel
  univariate split rules to partition the Euclidean feature space into rectangular
  regions. In practice, however, many regression problems involve features with multivariate
  structures (e.g., spatial locations) possibly lying in a manifold, where rectangular
  partitions may fail to respect irregular intrinsic geometry and boundary constraints
  of the structured feature space. In this paper, we develop a new class of Bayesian
  additive multivariate decision tree models that combine univariate split rules for
  handling possibly high dimensional features without known multivariate structures
  and novel multivariate split rules for features with multivariate structures in
  each weak learner. The proposed multivariate split rules are built upon stochastic
  predictive spanning tree bipartition models on reference knots, which are capable
  of achieving highly flexible nonlinear decision boundaries on manifold feature spaces
  while enabling efficient dimension reduction computations. We demonstrate the superior
  performance of the proposed method using simulation data and a Sacramento housing
  price data set.
