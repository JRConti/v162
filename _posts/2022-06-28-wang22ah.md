title: Nonparametric Embeddings of Sparse High-Order Interaction Events
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: High-order interaction events are common in real-world applications. Learning
  embeddings that encode the complex relationships of the participants from these
  events is of great importance in knowledge mining and predictive tasks. Despite
  the success of existing approaches, e.g. Poisson tensor factorization, they ignore
  the sparse structure underlying the data, namely the occurred interactions are far
  less than the possible interactions among all the participants. In this paper, we
  propose Nonparametric Embeddings of Sparse High-order interaction events (NESH).
  We hybridize a sparse hypergraph (tensor) process and a matrix Gaussian process
  to capture both the asymptotic structural sparsity within the interactions and nonlinear
  temporal relationships between the participants. We prove strong asymptotic bounds
  (including both a lower and an upper bound ) of the sparse ratio, which reveals
  the asymptotic properties of the sampled structure. We use batch-normalization,
  stick-breaking construction and sparse variational GP approximations to develop
  an efficient, scalable model inference algorithm. We demonstrate the advantage of
  our approach in several real-world applications.
