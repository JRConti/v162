title: Near-optimal rate of consistency for linear models with missing values
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Missing values arise in most real-world data sets due to the aggregation
  of multiple sources and intrinsically missing information (sensor failure, unanswered
  questions in surveys...). In fact, the very nature of missing values usually prevents
  us from running standard learning algorithms. In this paper, we focus on the extensively-studied
  linear models, but in presence of missing values, which turns out to be quite a
  challenging task. Indeed, the Bayes predictor can be decomposed as a sum of predictors
  corresponding to each missing pattern. This eventually requires to solve a number
  of learning tasks, exponential in the number of input features, which makes predictions
  impossible for current real-world datasets. First, we propose a rigorous setting
  to analyze a least-square type estimator and establish a bound on the excess risk
  which increases exponentially in the dimension. Consequently, we leverage the missing
  data distribution to propose a new algorithm, and derive associated adaptive risk
  bounds that turn out to be minimax optimal. Numerical experiments highlight the
  benefits of our method compared to state-of-the-art algorithms used for predictions
  with missing values.
