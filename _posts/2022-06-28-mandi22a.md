title: 'Decision-Focused Learning: Through the Lens of Learning to Rank'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In the last years decision-focused learning framework, also known as predict-and-optimize,
  have received increasing attention. In this setting, the predictions of a machine
  learning model are used as estimated cost coefficients in the objective function
  of a discrete combinatorial optimization problem for decision making. Decision-focused
  learning proposes to train the ML models, often neural network models, by directly
  optimizing the quality of decisions made by the optimization solvers. Based on a
  recent work that proposed a noise contrastive estimation loss over a subset of the
  solution space, we observe that decision-focused learning can more generally be
  seen as a learning-to-rank problem, where the goal is to learn an objective function
  that ranks the feasible points correctly. This observation is independent of the
  optimization method used and of the form of the objective function. We develop pointwise,
  pairwise and listwise ranking loss functions, which can be differentiated in closed
  form given a subset of solutions. We empirically investigate the quality of our
  generic methods compared to existing decision-focused learning approaches with competitive
  results. Furthermore, controlling the subset of solutions allows controlling the
  runtime considerably, with limited effect on regret.
