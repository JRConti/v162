title: Simple and near-optimal algorithms for hidden stratification and multi-group
  learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Multi-group agnostic learning is a formal learning criterion that is concerned
  with the conditional risks of predictors within subgroups of a population. The criterion
  addresses recent practical concerns such as subgroup fairness and hidden stratification.
  This paper studies the structure of solutions to the multi-group learning problem,
  and provides simple and near-optimal algorithms for the learning problem.
