title: An Initial Alignment between Neural Network and Target is Needed for Gradient
  Descent to Learn
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: This paper introduces the notion of “Initial Alignment” (INAL) between a
  neural network at initialization and a target function. It is proved that if a network
  and a Boolean target function do not have a noticeable INAL, then noisy gradient
  descent with normalized i.i.d. initialization will not learn in polynomial time.
  Thus a certain amount of knowledge about the target (measured by the INAL) is needed
  in the architecture design. This also provides an answer to an open problem posed
  in (AS-NeurIPS’20). The results are based on deriving lower-bounds for descent algorithms
  on symmetric neural networks without explicit knowledge of the target function beyond
  its INAL.
