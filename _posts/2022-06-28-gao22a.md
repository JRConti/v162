title: 'IDYNO: Learning Nonparametric DAGs from Interventional Dynamic Data'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Causal discovery in the form of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) for time
  series data has been widely studied in various domains. The resulting DAG typically
  represents a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN), capturing both the instantaneous and
  time-delayed relationships among variables of interest. We propose a new algorithm,
  IDYNO, to learn the DAG structure from potentially nonlinear times series data by
  using a continuous optimization framework that includes a recent formulation for
  continuous acyclicity constraint. The proposed algorithm is designed to handle both
  observational and interventional time series data. We demonstrate the promising
  performance of our method on synthetic benchmark datasets against state-of-the-art
  baselines. In addition, we show that the proposed method can more accurately learn
  the underlying structure of a sequential decision model, such as a Markov decision
  process, with a fixed policy in typical continuous control tasks.
