title: Data Augmentation as Feature Manipulation
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Data augmentation is a cornerstone of the machine learning pipeline, yet
  its theoretical underpinnings remain unclear. Is it merely a way to artificially
  augment the data set size? Or is it about encouraging the model to satisfy certain
  invariances? In this work we consider another angle, and we study the effect of
  data augmentation on the dynamic of the learning process. We find that data augmentation
  can alter the relative importance of various features, effectively making certain
  informative but hard to learn features more likely to be captured in the learning
  process. Importantly, we show that this effect is more pronounced for non-linear
  models, such as neural networks. Our main contribution is a detailed analysis of
  data augmentation on the learning dynamic for a two layer convolutional neural network
  in the recently proposed multi-view model by Z. Allen-Zhu and Y. Li. We complement
  this analysis with further experimental evidence that data augmentation can be viewed
  as a form of feature manipulation.
