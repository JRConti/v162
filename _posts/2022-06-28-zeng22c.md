title: 'Multi-Grained Vision Language Pre-Training: Aligning Texts with Visual Concepts'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Most existing methods in vision language pre-training rely on object-centric
  features extracted through object detection and make fine-grained alignments between
  the extracted features and texts. It is challenging for these methods to learn relations
  among multiple objects. To this end, we propose a new method called X-VLM to perform
  ‘multi-grained vision language pre-training.’ The key to learning multi-grained
  alignments is to locate visual concepts in the image given the associated texts,
  and in the meantime align the texts with the visual concepts, where the alignments
  are in multi-granularity. Experimental results show that X-VLM effectively leverages
  the learned multi-grained alignments to many downstream vision language tasks and
  consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
