title: Linear Bandit Algorithms with Sublinear Time Complexity
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We propose two linear bandits algorithms with per-step complexity sublinear
  in the number of arms $K$. The algorithms are designed for applications where the
  arm set is extremely large and slowly changing. Our key realization is that choosing
  an arm reduces to a maximum inner product search (MIPS) problem, which can be solved
  approximately without breaking regret guarantees. Existing approximate MIPS solvers
  run in sublinear time. We extend those solvers and present theoretical guarantees
  for online learning problems, where adaptivity (i.e., a later step depends on the
  feedback in previous steps) becomes a unique challenge. We then explicitly characterize
  the tradeoff between the per-step complexity and regret. For sufficiently large
  $K$, our algorithms have sublinear per-step complexity and $\widetilde O(\sqrt{T})$
  regret. Empirically, we evaluate our proposed algorithms in a synthetic environment
  and a real-world online movie recommendation problem. Our proposed algorithms can
  deliver a more than 72 times speedup compared to the linear time baselines while
  retaining similar regret.
