title: It’s Raw! Audio Generation with State-Space Models
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Developing architectures suitable for modeling raw audio is a challenging
  problem due to the high sampling rates of audio waveforms. Standard sequence modeling
  approaches like RNNs and CNNs have previously been tailored to fit the demands of
  audio, but the resultant architectures make undesirable computational tradeoffs
  and struggle to model waveforms effectively. We propose SaShiMi, a new multi-scale
  architecture for waveform modeling built around the recently introduced S4 model
  for long sequence modeling. We identify that S4 can be unstable during autoregressive
  generation, and provide a simple improvement to its parameterization by drawing
  connections to Hurwitz matrices. SaShiMi yields state-of-the-art performance for
  unconditional waveform generation in the autoregressive setting. Additionally, SaShiMi
  improves non-autoregressive generation performance when used as the backbone architecture
  for a diffusion model. Compared to prior architectures in the autoregressive generation
  setting, SaShiMi generates piano and speech waveforms which humans find more musical
  and coherent respectively, e.g. 2{\texttimes} better mean opinion scores than WaveNet
  on an unconditional speech generation task. On a music generation task, SaShiMi
  outperforms WaveNet on density estimation and speed at both training and inference
  even when using 3{\texttimes} fewer parameters
