title: Generalization Bounds using Lower Tail Exponents in Stochastic Optimizers
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Despite the ubiquitous use of stochastic optimization algorithms in machine
  learning, the precise impact of these algorithms and their dynamics on generalization
  performance in realistic non-convex settings is still poorly understood. While recent
  work has revealed connections between generalization and heavy-tailed behavior in
  stochastic optimization, they mainly relied on continuous-time approximations; and
  a rigorous treatment for the original discrete-time iterations is yet to be performed.
  To bridge this gap, we present novel bounds linking generalization to the lower
  tail exponent of the transition kernel associated with the optimizer around a local
  minimum, in both discrete- and continuous-time settings. To achieve this, we first
  prove a data- and algorithm-dependent generalization bound in terms of the celebrated
  Fernique-Talagrand functional applied to the trajectory of the optimizer. Then,
  we specialize this result by exploiting the Markovian structure of stochastic optimizers,
  and derive bounds in terms of their (data-dependent) transition kernels. We support
  our theory with empirical results from a variety of neural networks, showing correlations
  between generalization error and lower tail exponents.
