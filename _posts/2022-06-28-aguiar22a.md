title: Learning of Cluster-based Feature Importance for Electronic Health Record Time-series
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The recent availability of Electronic Health Records (EHR) has allowed for
  the development of algorithms predicting inpatient risk of deterioration and trajectory
  evolution. However, prediction of disease progression with EHR is challenging since
  these data are sparse, heterogeneous, multi-dimensional, and multi-modal time-series.
  As such, clustering is regularly used to identify similar groups within the patient
  cohort to improve prediction. Current models have shown some success in obtaining
  cluster representations of patient trajectories. However, they i) fail to obtain
  clinical interpretability for each cluster, and ii) struggle to learn meaningful
  cluster numbers in the context of imbalanced distribution of disease outcomes. We
  propose a supervised deep learning model to cluster EHR data based on the identification
  of clinically understandable phenotypes with regard to both outcome prediction and
  patient trajectory. We introduce novel loss functions to address the problems of
  class imbalance and cluster collapse, and furthermore propose a feature-time attention
  mechanism to identify cluster-based phenotype importance across time and feature
  dimensions. We tested our model in two datasets corresponding to distinct medical
  settings. Our model yielded added interpretability to cluster formation and outperformed
  benchmarks by at least 4% in relevant metrics.
