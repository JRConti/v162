title: A Theoretical Comparison of Graph Neural Network Extensions
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We study and compare different Graph Neural Network extensions that increase
  the expressive power of GNNs beyond the Weisfeiler-Leman test. We focus on (i) GNNs
  based on higher order WL methods, (ii) GNNs that preprocess small substructures
  in the graph, (iii) GNNs that preprocess the graph up to a small radius, and (iv)
  GNNs that slightly perturb the graph to compute an embedding. We begin by presenting
  a simple improvement for this last extension that strictly increases the expressive
  power of this GNN variant. Then, as our main result, we compare the expressiveness
  of these extensions to each other through a series of example constructions that
  can be distinguished by one of the extensions, but not by another one. We also show
  negative examples that are particularly challenging for each of the extensions,
  and we prove several claims about the ability of these extensions to count cliques
  and cycles in the graph.
