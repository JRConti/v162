title: Generalized Data Distribution Iteration
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'To obtain higher sample efficiency and superior final performance simultaneously
  has been one of the major challenges for deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Previous
  work could handle one of these challenges but typically failed to address them concurrently.
  In this paper, we try to tackle these two challenges simultaneously. To achieve
  this, we firstly decouple these challenges into two classic RL problems: data richness
  and exploration-exploitation trade-off. Then, we cast these two problems into the
  training data distribution optimization problem, namely to obtain desired training
  data within limited interactions, and address them concurrently via i) explicit
  modeling and control of the capacity and diversity of behavior policy and ii) more
  fine-grained and adaptive control of selective/sampling distribution of the behavior
  policy using a monotonic data distribution optimization. Finally, we integrate this
  process into Generalized Policy Iteration (GPI) and obtain a more general framework
  called Generalized Data Distribution Iteration (GDI). We use the GDI framework to
  introduce operator-based versions of well-known RL methods from DQN to Agent57.
  Theoretical guarantee of the superiority of GDI compared with GPI is concluded.
  We also demonstrate our state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on Arcade Learning Environment
  (ALE), wherein our algorithm has achieved 9620.98% mean human normalized score (HNS),
  1146.39% median HNS, and surpassed 22 human world records using only 200M training
  frames. Our performance is comparable to Agent57â€™s while we consume 500 times less
  data. We argue that there is still a long way to go before obtaining real superhuman
  agents in ALE.'
