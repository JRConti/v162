title: Low-Complexity Deep Convolutional Neural Networks on Fully Homomorphic Encryption
  Using Multiplexed Parallel Convolutions
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Recently, the standard ResNet-20 network was successfully implemented on
  the fully homomorphic encryption scheme, residue number system variant Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song
  (RNS-CKKS) scheme using bootstrapping, but the implementation lacks practicality
  due to high latency and low security level. To improve the performance, we first
  minimize total bootstrapping runtime using multiplexed parallel convolution that
  collects sparse output data for multiple channels compactly. We also propose the
  imaginary-removing bootstrapping to prevent the deep neural networks from catastrophic
  divergence during approximate ReLU operations. In addition, we optimize level consumptions
  and use lighter and tighter parameters. Simulation results show that we have 4.67x
  lower inference latency and 134x less amortized runtime (runtime per image) for
  ResNet-20 compared to the state-of-the-art previous work, and we achieve standard
  128-bit security. Furthermore, we successfully implement ResNet-110 with high accuracy
  on the RNS-CKKS scheme for the first time.
