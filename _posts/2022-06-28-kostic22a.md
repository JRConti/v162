title: 'Batch Greenkhorn Algorithm for Entropic-Regularized Multimarginal Optimal
  Transport: Linear Rate of Convergence and Iteration Complexity'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In this work we propose a batch multimarginal version of the Greenkhorn
  algorithm for the entropic-regularized optimal transport problem. This framework
  is general enough to cover, as particular cases, existing Sinkhorn and Greenkhorn
  algorithms for the bi-marginal setting, and greedy MultiSinkhorn for the general
  multimarginal case. We provide a comprehensive convergence analysis based on the
  properties of the iterative Bregman projections method with greedy control. Linear
  rate of convergence as well as explicit bounds on the iteration complexity are obtained.
  When specialized to the above mentioned algorithms, our results give new convergence
  rates or provide key improvements over the state-of-the-art rates. We present numerical
  experiments showing that the flexibility of the batch can be exploited to improve
  performance of Sinkhorn algorithm both in bi-marginal and multimarginal settings.
