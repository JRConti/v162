title: Probabilistic ODE Solutions in Millions of Dimensions
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Probabilistic solvers for ordinary differential equations (ODEs) have emerged
  as an efficient framework for uncertainty quantification and inference on dynamical
  systems. In this work, we explain the mathematical assumptions and detailed implementation
  schemes behind solving high-dimensional ODEs with a probabilistic numerical algorithm.
  This has not been possible before due to matrix-matrix operations in each solver
  step, but is crucial for scientifically relevant problems—most importantly, the
  solution of discretised partial differential equations. In a nutshell, efficient
  high-dimensional probabilistic ODE solutions build either on independence assumptions
  or on Kronecker structure in the prior model. We evaluate the resulting efficiency
  on a range of problems, including the probabilistic numerical simulation of a differential
  equation with millions of dimensions.
