title: Understanding Robust Overfitting of Adversarial Training and Beyond
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Robust overfitting widely exists in adversarial training of deep networks.
  The exact underlying reasons for this are still not completely understood. Here,
  we explore the causes of robust overfitting by comparing the data distribution of
  non-overfit (weak adversary) and overfitted (strong adversary) adversarial training,
  and observe that the distribution of the adversarial data generated by weak adversary
  mainly contain small-loss data. However, the adversarial data generated by strong
  adversary is more diversely distributed on the large-loss data and the small-loss
  data. Given these observations, we further designed data ablation adversarial training
  and identify that some small-loss data which are not worthy of the adversary strength
  cause robust overfitting in the strong adversary mode. To relieve this issue, we
  propose minimum loss constrained adversarial training (MLCAT): in a minibatch, we
  learn large-loss data as usual, and adopt additional measures to increase the loss
  of the small-loss data. Technically, MLCAT hinders data fitting when they become
  easy to learn to prevent robust overfitting; philosophically, MLCAT reflects the
  spirit of turning waste into treasure and making the best use of each adversarial
  data; algorithmically, we designed two realizations of MLCAT, and extensive experiments
  demonstrate that MLCAT can eliminate robust overfitting and further boost adversarial
  robustness.'
