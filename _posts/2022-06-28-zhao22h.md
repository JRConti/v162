title: Efficient Learning for AlphaZero via Path Consistency
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In recent years, deep reinforcement learning have made great breakthroughs
  on board games. Still, most of the works require huge computational resources for
  a large scale of environmental interactions or self-play for the games. This paper
  aims at building powerful models under a limited amount of self-plays which can
  be utilized by a human throughout the lifetime. We proposes a learning algorithm
  built on AlphaZero, with its path searching regularised by a path consistency (PC)
  optimality, i.e., values on one optimal search path should be identical. Thus, the
  algorithm is shortly named PCZero. In implementation, historical trajectory and
  scouted search paths by MCTS makes a good balance between exploration and exploitation,
  which enhances the generalization ability effectively. PCZero obtains $94.1%$ winning
  rate against the champion of Hex Computer Olympiad in 2015 on $13\times 13$ Hex,
  much higher than $84.3%$ by AlphaZero. The models consume only $900K$ self-play
  games, about the amount humans can study in a lifetime. The improvements by PCZero
  have been also generalized to Othello and Gomoku. Experiments also demonstrate the
  efficiency of PCZero under offline learning setting.
