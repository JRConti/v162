title: Steerable 3D Spherical Neurons
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Emerging from low-level vision theory, steerable filters found their counterpart
  in prior work on steerable convolutional neural networks equivariant to rigid transformations.
  In our work, we propose a steerable feed-forward learning-based approach that consists
  of neurons with spherical decision surfaces and operates on point clouds. Such spherical
  neurons are obtained by conformal embedding of Euclidean space and have recently
  been revisited in the context of learning representations of point sets. Focusing
  on 3D geometry, we exploit the isometry property of spherical neurons and derive
  a 3D steerability constraint. After training spherical neurons to classify point
  clouds in a canonical orientation, we use a tetrahedron basis to quadruplicate the
  neurons and construct rotation-equivariant spherical filter banks. We then apply
  the derived constraint to interpolate the filter bank outputs and, thus, obtain
  a rotation-invariant network. Finally, we use a synthetic point set and real-world
  3D skeleton data to verify our theoretical findings. The code is available at https://github.com/pavlo-melnyk/steerable-3d-neurons.
