title: The power of first-order smooth optimization for black-box non-smooth problems
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Gradient-free/zeroth-order methods for black-box convex optimization have
  been extensively studied in the last decade with the main focus on oracle calls
  complexity. In this paper, besides the oracle complexity, we focus also on iteration
  complexity, and propose a generic approach that, based on optimal first-order methods,
  allows to obtain in a black-box fashion new zeroth-order algorithms for non-smooth
  convex optimization problems. Our approach not only leads to optimal oracle complexity,
  but also allows to obtain iteration complexity similar to first-order methods, which,
  in turn, allows to exploit parallel computations to accelerate the convergence of
  our algorithms. We also elaborate on extensions for stochastic optimization problems,
  saddle-point problems, and distributed optimization.
