title: Individual Preference Stability for Clustering
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In this paper, we propose a natural notion of individual preference (IP)
  stability for clustering, which asks that every data point, on average, is closer
  to the points in its own cluster than to the points in any other cluster. Our notion
  can be motivated from several perspectives, including game theory and algorithmic
  fairness. We study several questions related to our proposed notion. We first show
  that deciding whether a given data set allows for an IP-stable clustering in general
  is NP-hard. As a result, we explore the design of efficient algorithms for finding
  IP-stable clusterings in some restricted metric spaces. We present a polytime algorithm
  to find a clustering satisfying exact IP-stability on the real line, and an efficient
  algorithm to find an IP-stable 2-clustering for a tree metric. We also consider
  relaxing the stability constraint, i.e., every data point should not be too far
  from its own cluster compared to any other cluster. For this case, we provide polytime
  algorithms with different guarantees. We evaluate some of our algorithms and several
  standard clustering approaches on real data sets.
