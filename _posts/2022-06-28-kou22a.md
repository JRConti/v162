title: Certified Adversarial Robustness Under the Bounded Support Set
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have revealed severe vulnerability to adversarial
  perturbations, beside empirical adversarial training for robustness, the design
  of provably robust classifiers attracts more and more attention. Randomized smoothing
  methods provide the certified robustness with agnostic architecture, which is further
  extended to a provable robustness framework using f-divergence. While these methods
  cannot be applied to smoothing measures with bounded support set such as uniform
  probability measure due to the use of likelihood ratio in their certification methods.
  In this paper, we generalize the $f$-divergence-based framework to a Wasserstein-distance-based
  and total-variation-distance-based framework that is first able to analyze robustness
  properties of bounded support set smoothing measures both theoretically and experimentally.
  By applying our methodology to uniform probability measures with support set $l_p
  (p=1,2,\infty\text{ and general})$ ball, we prove negative certified robustness
  properties with respect to $l_q (q=1, 2, \infty)$ perturbations and present experimental
  results on CIFAR-10 dataset with ResNet to validate our theory. And it is also worth
  mentioning that our certification procedure only costs constant computation time.
