title: Variational Wasserstein gradient flow
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Wasserstein gradient flow has emerged as a promising approach to solve
  optimization problems over the space of probability distributions. A recent trend
  is to use the well-known JKO scheme in combination with input convex neural networks
  to numerically implement the proximal step. The most challenging step, in this setup,
  is to evaluate functions involving density explicitly, such as entropy, in terms
  of samples. This paper builds on the recent works with a slight but crucial difference:
  we propose to utilize a variational formulation of the objective function formulated
  as maximization over a parametric class of functions. Theoretically, the proposed
  variational formulation allows the construction of gradient flows directly for empirical
  distributions with a well-defined and meaningful objective function. Computationally,
  this approach replaces the computationally expensive step in existing methods, to
  handle objective functions involving density, with inner loop updates that only
  require a small batch of samples and scale well with the dimension. The performance
  and scalability of the proposed method are illustrated with the aid of several numerical
  experiments involving high-dimensional synthetic and real datasets.'
