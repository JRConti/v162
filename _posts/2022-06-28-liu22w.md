title: Robust Training under Label Noise by Over-parameterization
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Recently, over-parameterized deep networks, with increasingly more network
  parameters than training samples, have dominated the performances of modern machine
  learning. However, when the training data is corrupted, it has been well-known that
  over-parameterized networks tend to overfit and do not generalize. In this work,
  we propose a principled approach for robust training of over-parameterized deep
  networks in classification tasks where a proportion of training labels are corrupted.
  The main idea is yet very simple: label noise is sparse and incoherent with the
  network learned from clean data, so we model the noise and learn to separate it
  from the data. Specifically, we model the label noise via another sparse over-parameterization
  term, and exploit implicit algorithmic regularizations to recover and separate the
  underlying corruptions. Remarkably, when trained using such a simple method in practice,
  we demonstrate state-of-the-art test accuracy against label noise on a variety of
  real datasets. Furthermore, our experimental results are corroborated by theory
  on simplified linear models, showing that exact separation between sparse noise
  and low-rank data can be achieved under incoherent conditions. The work opens many
  interesting directions for improving over-parameterized models by using sparse over-parameterization
  and implicit regularization. Code is available at https://github.com/shengliu66/SOP.'
