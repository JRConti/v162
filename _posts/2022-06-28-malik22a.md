title: More Efficient Sampling for Tensor Decomposition With Worst-Case Guarantees
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Recent papers have developed alternating least squares (ALS) methods for
  CP and tensor ring decomposition with a per-iteration cost which is sublinear in
  the number of input tensor entries for low-rank decomposition. However, the per-iteration
  cost of these methods still has an exponential dependence on the number of tensor
  modes when parameters are chosen to achieve certain worst-case guarantees. In this
  paper, we propose sampling-based ALS methods for the CP and tensor ring decompositions
  whose cost does not have this exponential dependence, thereby significantly improving
  on the previous state-of-the-art. We provide a detailed theoretical analysis and
  also apply the methods in a feature extraction experiment.
