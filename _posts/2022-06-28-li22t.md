title: 'CerDEQ: Certifiable Deep Equilibrium Model'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Recently, certifiable robust training methods via bound propagation have
  been proposed for training neural networks with certifiable robustness guarantees.
  However, no neural architectures with regular convolution and linear layers perform
  better in the certifiable training than the plain CNNs, since the output bounds
  for the deep explicit models increase quickly as their depth increases. And such
  a phenomenon significantly hinders certifiable training. Meanwhile, the Deep Equilibrium
  Model (DEQ) is more representative and robust due to their equivalent infinite depth
  and controllable global Lipschitz. But no work has been proposed to explore whether
  DEQ can show advantages in certified training. In this work, we aim to tackle the
  problem of DEQ’s certified training. To obtain the output bound based on the bound
  propagation scheme in the implicit model, we first involve the adjoint DEQ for bound
  approximation. Furthermore, we also use the weight orthogonalization method and
  other tricks specified for DEQ to stabilize the certifiable training. With our approach,
  we can obtain the certifiable DEQ called CerDEQ. Our CerDEQ can achieve state-of-the-art
  performance compared with models using regular convolution and linear layers on
  $\ell_\infty$ tasks with $\epsilon=8/255$: $64.72%$ certified error for CIFAR-$10$
  and $94.45%$ certified error for Tiny ImageNet.'
