title: Image-to-Image Regression with Distribution-Free Uncertainty Quantification
  and Applications in Imaging
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Image-to-image regression is an important learning task, used frequently
  in biological imaging. Current algorithms, however, do not generally offer statistical
  guarantees that protect against a model’s mistakes and hallucinations. To address
  this, we develop uncertainty quantification techniques with rigorous statistical
  guarantees for image-to-image regression problems. In particular, we show how to
  derive uncertainty intervals around each pixel that are guaranteed to contain the
  true value with a user-specified confidence probability. Our methods work in conjunction
  with any base machine learning model, such as a neural network, and endow it with
  formal mathematical guarantees{—}regardless of the true unknown data distribution
  or choice of model. Furthermore, they are simple to implement and computationally
  inexpensive. We evaluate our procedure on three image-to-image regression tasks:
  quantitative phase microscopy, accelerated magnetic resonance imaging, and super-resolution
  transmission electron microscopy of a Drosophila melanogaster brain.'
