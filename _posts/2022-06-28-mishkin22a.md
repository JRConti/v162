title: 'Fast Convex Optimization for Two-Layer ReLU Networks: Equivalent Model Classes
  and Cone Decompositions'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We develop fast algorithms and robust software for convex optimization of
  two-layer neural networks with ReLU activation functions. Our work leverages a convex
  re-formulation of the standard weight-decay penalized training problem as a set
  of group-l1-regularized data-local models, where locality is enforced by polyhedral
  cone constraints. In the special case of zero-regularization, we show that this
  problem is exactly equivalent to unconstrained optimization of a convex "gated ReLU"
  network. For problems with non-zero regularization, we show that convex gated ReLU
  models obtain data-dependent approximation bounds for the ReLU training problem.
  To optimize the convex re-formulations, we develop an accelerated proximal gradient
  method and a practical augmented Lagrangian solver. We show that these approaches
  are faster than standard training heuristics for the non-convex problem, such as
  SGD, and outperform commercial interior-point solvers. Experimentally, we verify
  our theoretical results, explore the group-l1 regularization path, and scale convex
  optimization for neural networks to image classification on MNIST and CIFAR-10.
