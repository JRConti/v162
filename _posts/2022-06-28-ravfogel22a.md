title: Linear Adversarial Concept Erasure
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Modern neural models trained on textual data rely on pre-trained representations
  that emerge without direct supervision. As these representations are increasingly
  being used in real-world applications, the inability to <em>control</em> their content
  becomes an increasingly important problem. In this work, we formulate the problem
  of identifying a linear subspace that corresponds to a given concept, and removing
  it from the representation. We formulate this problem as a constrained, linear minimax
  game, and show that existing solutions are generally not optimal for this task.
  We derive a closed-form solution for certain objectives, and propose a convex relaxation
  that works well for others. When evaluated in the context of binary gender removal,
  the method recovers a low-dimensional subspace whose removal mitigates bias by intrinsic
  and extrinsic evaluation. Surprisingly, we show that the method—despite being linear—is
  highly expressive, effectively mitigating bias in the output layers of deep, nonlinear
  classifiers while maintaining tractability and interpretability.
