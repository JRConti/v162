title: 'N-Penetrate: Active Learning of Neural Collision Handler for Complex 3D Mesh
  Deformations'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We present a robust learning algorithm to detect and handle collisions in
  3D deforming meshes. We first train a neural network to detect collisions and then
  use a numerical optimization algorithm to resolve penetrations guided by the network.
  Our learned collision handler can resolve collisions for unseen, high-dimensional
  meshes with thousands of vertices. To obtain stable network performance in such
  large and unseen spaces, we apply active learning by progressively inserting new
  collision data based on the network inferences. We automatically label these new
  data using an analytical collision detector and progressively fine-tune our detection
  networks. We evaluate our method for collision handling of complex, 3D meshes coming
  from several datasets with different shapes and topologies, including datasets corresponding
  to dressed and undressed human poses, cloth simulations, and human hand poses acquired
  using multi-view capture systems.
