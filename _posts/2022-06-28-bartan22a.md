  Polynomial Time'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Fisher’s Linear Discriminant Analysis (FLDA) is a statistical analysis method
  that linearly embeds data points to a lower dimensional space to maximize a discrimination
  criterion such that the variance between classes is maximized while the variance
  within classes is minimized. We introduce a natural extension of FLDA that employs
  neural networks, called Neural Fisher Discriminant Analysis (NFDA). This method
  finds the optimal two-layer neural network that embeds data points to optimize the
  same discrimination criterion. We use tools from convex optimization to transform
  the optimal neural network embedding problem into a convex problem. The resulting
  problem is easy to interpret and solve to global optimality. We evaluate the method’s
  performance on synthetic and real datasets.
