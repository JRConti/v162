title: The Multivariate Community Hawkes Model for Dependent Relational Events in
  Continuous-time Networks
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'The stochastic block model (SBM) is one of the most widely used generative
  models for network data. Many continuous-time dynamic network models are built upon
  the same assumption as the SBM: edges or events between all pairs of nodes are conditionally
  independent given the block or community memberships, which prevents them from reproducing
  higher-order motifs such as triangles that are commonly observed in real networks.
  We propose the multivariate community Hawkes (MULCH) model, an extremely flexible
  community-based model for continuous-time networks that introduces dependence between
  node pairs using structured multivariate Hawkes processes. We fit the model using
  a spectral clustering and likelihood-based local refinement procedure. We find that
  our proposed MULCH model is far more accurate than existing models both for predictive
  and generative tasks.'
