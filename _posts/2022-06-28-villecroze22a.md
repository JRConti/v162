title: Bayesian Nonparametrics for Offline Skill Discovery
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Skills or low-level policies in reinforcement learning are temporally extended
  actions that can speed up learning and enable complex behaviours. Recent work in
  offline reinforcement learning and imitation learning has proposed several techniques
  for skill discovery from a set of expert trajectories. While these methods are promising,
  the number K of skills to discover is always a fixed hyperparameter, which requires
  either prior knowledge about the environment or an additional parameter search to
  tune it. We first propose a method for offline learning of options (a particular
  skill framework) exploiting advances in variational inference and continuous relaxations.
  We then highlight an unexplored connection between Bayesian nonparametrics and offline
  skill discovery, and show how to obtain a nonparametric version of our model. This
  version is tractable thanks to a carefully structured approximate posterior with
  a dynamically-changing number of options, removing the need to specify K. We also
  show how our nonparametric extension can be applied in other skill frameworks, and
  empirically demonstrate that our method can outperform state-of-the-art offline
  skill learning algorithms across a variety of environments.
