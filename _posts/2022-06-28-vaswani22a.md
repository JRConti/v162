title: Towards Noise-adaptive, Problem-adaptive (Accelerated) Stochastic Gradient
  Descent
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We aim to make stochastic gradient descent (SGD) adaptive to (i) the noise
  $\sigma^2$ in the stochastic gradients and (ii) problem-dependent constants. When
  minimizing smooth, strongly-convex functions with condition number $\kappa$, we
  prove that $T$ iterations of SGD with exponentially decreasing step-sizes and knowledge
  of the smoothness can achieve an $\tilde{O} \left(\exp \left( \nicefrac{-T}{\kappa}
  \right) + \nicefrac{\sigma^2}{T} \right)$ rate, without knowing $\sigma^2$. In order
  to be adaptive to the smoothness, we use a stochastic line-search (SLS) and show
  (via upper and lower-bounds) that SGD with SLS converges at the desired rate, but
  only to a neighbourhood of the solution. On the other hand, we prove that SGD with
  an offline estimate of the smoothness converges to the minimizer. However, its rate
  is slowed down proportional to the estimation error. Next, we prove that SGD with
  Nesterov acceleration and exponential step-sizes (referred to as ASGD) can achieve
  the near-optimal $\tilde{O} \left(\exp \left( \nicefrac{-T}{\sqrt{\kappa}} \right)
  + \nicefrac{\sigma^2}{T} \right)$ rate, without knowledge of $\sigma^2$. When used
  with offline estimates of the smoothness and strong-convexity, ASGD still converges
  to the solution, albeit at a slower rate. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the
  effectiveness of exponential step-sizes coupled with a novel variant of SLS.
