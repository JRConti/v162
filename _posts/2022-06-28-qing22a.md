title: Spectral Representation of Robustness Measures for Optimization Under Input
  Uncertainty
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We study the inference of mean-variance robustness measures to quantify
  input uncertainty under the Gaussian Process (GP) framework. These measures are
  widely used in applications where the robustness of the solution is of interest,
  for example, in engineering design. While the variance is commonly used to characterize
  the robustness, Bayesian inference of the variance using GPs is known to be challenging.
  In this paper, we propose a Spectral Representation of Robustness Measures based
  on the GPâ€™s spectral representation, i.e., an analytical approach to approximately
  infer both robustness measures for normal and uniform input uncertainty distributions.
  We present two approximations based on different Fourier features and compare their
  accuracy numerically. To demonstrate their utility and efficacy in robust Bayesian
  Optimization, we integrate the analytical robustness measures in three standard
  acquisition functions for various robust optimization formulations. We show their
  competitive performance on numerical benchmarks and real-life applications.
