title: A data-driven approach for learning to control computers
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: It would be useful for machines to use computers as humans do so that they
  can aid us in everyday tasks. This is a setting in which there is also the potential
  to leverage large-scale expert demonstrations and human judgements of interactive
  behaviour, which are two ingredients that have driven much recent success in AI.
  Here we investigate the setting of computer control using keyboard and mouse, with
  goals specified via natural language. Instead of focusing on hand-designed curricula
  and specialized action spaces, we focus on developing a scalable method centered
  on reinforcement learning combined with behavioural priors informed by actual human-computer
  interactions. We achieve state-of-the-art and human-level mean performance across
  all tasks within the MiniWob++ benchmark, a challenging suite of computer control
  problems, and find strong evidence of cross-task transfer. These results demonstrate
  the usefulness of a unified human-agent interface when training machines to use
  computers. Altogether our results suggest a formula for achieving competency beyond
  MiniWob++ and towards controlling computers, in general, as a human would.
