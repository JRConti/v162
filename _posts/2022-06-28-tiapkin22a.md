abstract: 'We propose the Bayes-UCBVI algorithm for reinforcement learning in tabular,
  stage-dependent, episodic Markov decision process: a natural extension of the Bayes-UCB
  algorithm by Kaufmann et al. 2012 for multi-armed bandits. Our method uses the quantile
  of a Q-value function posterior as upper confidence bound on the optimal Q-value
  function. For Bayes-UCBVI, we prove a regret bound of order $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{H^3SAT})$
  where $H$ is the length of one episode, $S$ is the number of states, $A$ the number
  of actions, $T$ the number of episodes, that matches the lower-bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{H^3SAT})$
  up to poly-$\log$ terms in $H,S,A,T$ for a large enough $T$. To the best of our
  knowledge, this is the first algorithm that obtains an optimal dependence on the
  horizon $H$ (and $S$) <em>without the need of an involved Bernstein-like bonus or
  noise.</em> Crucial to our analysis is a new fine-grained anti-concentration bound
  for a weighted Dirichlet sum that can be of independent interest. We then explain
  how Bayes-UCBVI can be easily extended beyond the tabular setting, exhibiting a
  strong link between our algorithm and Bayesian bootstrap (Rubin,1981).'
