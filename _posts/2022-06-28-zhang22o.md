title: Personalized Federated Learning via Variational Bayesian Inference
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Federated learning faces huge challenges from model overfitting due to the
  lack of data and statistical diversity among clients. To address these challenges,
  this paper proposes a novel personalized federated learning method via Bayesian
  variational inference named pFedBayes. To alleviate the overfitting, weight uncertainty
  is introduced to neural networks for clients and the server. To achieve personalization,
  each client updates its local distribution parameters by balancing its construction
  error over private data and its KL divergence with global distribution from the
  server. Theoretical analysis gives an upper bound of averaged generalization error
  and illustrates that the convergence rate of the generalization error is minimax
  optimal up to a logarithmic factor. Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms
  other advanced personalized methods on personalized models, e.g., pFedBayes respectively
  outperforms other SOTA algorithms by 1.25%, 0.42% and 11.71% on MNIST, FMNIST and
  CIFAR-10 under non-i.i.d. limited data.
