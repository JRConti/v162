title: Improving Out-of-Distribution Robustness via Selective Augmentation
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Machine learning algorithms typically assume that training and test examples
  are drawn from the same distribution. However, distribution shift is a common problem
  in real-world applications and can cause models to perform dramatically worse at
  test time. In this paper, we specifically consider the problems of subpopulation
  shifts (e.g., imbalanced data) and domain shifts. While prior works often seek to
  explicitly regularize internal representations or predictors of the model to be
  domain invariant, we instead aim to learn invariant predictors without restricting
  the modelâ€™s internal representations or predictors. This leads to a simple mixup-based
  technique which learns invariant predictors via selective augmentation called LISA.
  LISA selectively interpolates samples either with the same labels but different
  domains or with the same domain but different labels. Empirically, we study the
  effectiveness of LISA on nine benchmarks ranging from subpopulation shifts to domain
  shifts, and we find that LISA consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods
  and leads to more invariant predictors. We further analyze a linear setting and
  theoretically show how LISA leads to a smaller worst-group error.
