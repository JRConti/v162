title: 'Plug-In Inversion: Model-Agnostic Inversion for Vision with Data Augmentations'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Existing techniques for model inversion typically rely on hard-to-tune regularizers,
  such as total variation or feature regularization, which must be individually calibrated
  for each network in order to produce adequate images. In this work, we introduce
  Plug-In Inversion, which relies on a simple set of augmentations and does not require
  excessive hyper-parameter tuning. Under our proposed augmentation-based scheme,
  the same set of augmentation hyper-parameters can be used for inverting a wide range
  of image classification models, regardless of input dimensions or the architecture.
  We illustrate the practicality of our approach by inverting Vision Transformers
  (ViTs) and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) trained on the ImageNet dataset, tasks
  which to the best of our knowledge have not been successfully accomplished by any
  previous works.
