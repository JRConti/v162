title: Contrastive Mixture of Posteriors for Counterfactual Inference, Data Integration
  and Fairness
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Learning meaningful representations of data that can address challenges
  such as batch effect correction and counterfactual inference is a central problem
  in many domains including computational biology. Adopting a Conditional VAE framework,
  we show that marginal independence between the representation and a condition variable
  plays a key role in both of these challenges. We propose the Contrastive Mixture
  of Posteriors (CoMP) method that uses a novel misalignment penalty defined in terms
  of mixtures of the variational posteriors to enforce this independence in latent
  space. We show that CoMP has attractive theoretical properties compared to previous
  approaches, and we prove counterfactual identifiability of CoMP under additional
  assumptions. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on a set of challenging
  tasks including aligning human tumour samples with cancer cell-lines, predicting
  transcriptome-level perturbation responses, and batch correction on single-cell
  RNA sequencing data. We also find parallels to fair representation learning and
  demonstrate that CoMP is competitive on a common task in the field.
