title: 'Retroformer: Pushing the Limits of End-to-end Retrosynthesis Transformer'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Retrosynthesis prediction is one of the fundamental challenges in organic
  synthesis. The task is to predict the reactants given a core product. With the advancement
  of machine learning, computer-aided synthesis planning has gained increasing interest.
  Numerous methods were proposed to solve this problem with different levels of dependency
  on additional chemical knowledge. In this paper, we propose Retroformer, a novel
  Transformer-based architecture for retrosynthesis prediction without relying on
  any cheminformatics tools for molecule editing. Via the proposed local attention
  head, the model can jointly encode the molecular sequence and graph, and efficiently
  exchange information between the local reactive region and the global reaction context.
  Retroformer reaches the new state-of-the-art accuracy for the end-to-end template-free
  retrosynthesis, and improves over many strong baselines on better molecule and reaction
  validity. In addition, its generative procedure is highly interpretable and controllable.
  Overall, Retroformer pushes the limits of the reaction reasoning ability of deep
  generative models.
