title: Efficient Approximate Inference for Stationary Kernel on Frequency Domain
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Based on the Fourier duality between a stationary kernel and its spectral
  density, modeling the spectral density using a Gaussian mixture density enables
  one to construct a flexible kernel, known as a Spectral Mixture kernel, that can
  model any stationary kernel. However, despite its expressive power, training this
  kernel is typically difficult because scalability and overfitting issues often arise
  due to a large number of training parameters. To resolve these issues, we propose
  an approximate inference method for estimating the Spectral mixture kernel hyperparameters.
  Specifically, we approximate this kernel by using the finite random spectral points
  based on Random Fourier Feature and optimize the parameters for the distribution
  of spectral points by sampling-based variational inference. To improve this inference
  procedure, we analyze the training loss and propose two special methods: a sampling
  method of spectral points to reduce the error of the approximate kernel in training,
  and an approximate natural gradient to accelerate the convergence of parameter inference.'
