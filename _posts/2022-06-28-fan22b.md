title: 'DRIBO: Robust Deep Reinforcement Learning via Multi-View Information Bottleneck'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents are often sensitive to visual changes
  that were unseen in their training environments. To address this problem, we leverage
  the sequential nature of RL to learn robust representations that encode only task-relevant
  information from observations based on the unsupervised multi-view setting. Specif-
  ically, we introduce a novel contrastive version of the Multi-View Information Bottleneck
  (MIB) objective for temporal data. We train RL agents from pixels with this auxiliary
  objective to learn robust representations that can compress away task-irrelevant
  information and are predictive of task-relevant dynamics. This approach enables
  us to train high-performance policies that are robust to visual distractions and
  can generalize well to unseen environments. We demonstrate that our approach can
  achieve SOTA performance on a di- verse set of visual control tasks in the DeepMind
  Control Suite when the background is replaced with natural videos. In addition,
  we show that our approach outperforms well-established base- lines for generalization
  to unseen environments on the Procgen benchmark. Our code is open- sourced and available
  at https://github. com/BU-DEPEND-Lab/DRIBO.
