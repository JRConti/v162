title: No-Regret Learning in Time-Varying Zero-Sum Games
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Learning from repeated play in a fixed two-player zero-sum game is a classic
  problem in game theory and online learning. We consider a variant of this problem
  where the game payoff matrix changes over time, possibly in an adversarial manner.
  We first present three performance measures to guide the algorithmic design for
  this problem: 1) the well-studied <em>individual regret</em>, 2) an extension of
  <em>duality gap</em>, and 3) a new measure called <em>dynamic Nash Equilibrium regret</em>,
  which quantifies the cumulative difference between the playerâ€™s payoff and the minimax
  game value. Next, we develop a single parameter-free algorithm that <em>simultaneously</em>
  enjoys favorable guarantees under all these three performance measures. These guarantees
  are adaptive to different non-stationarity measures of the payoff matrices and,
  importantly, recover the best known results when the payoff matrix is fixed. Our
  algorithm is based on a two-layer structure with a meta-algorithm learning over
  a group of black-box base-learners satisfying a certain property, along with several
  novel ingredients specifically designed for the time-varying game setting. Empirical
  results further validate the effectiveness of our algorithm.'
