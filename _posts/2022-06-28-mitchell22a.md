title: Memory-Based Model Editing at Scale
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Even the largest neural networks make errors, and once-correct predictions
  can become invalid as the world changes. Model editors make local updates to the
  behavior of base (pre-trained) models to inject updated knowledge or correct undesirable
  behaviors. Existing model editors have shown promise, but also suffer from insufficient
  expressiveness: they struggle to accurately model an edit’s intended scope (examples
  affected by the edit), leading to inaccurate predictions for test inputs loosely
  related to the edit, and they often fail altogether after many edits. As a higher-capacity
  alternative, we propose Semi-Parametric Editing with a Retrieval-Augmented Counterfactual
  Model (SERAC), which stores edits in an explicit memory and learns to reason over
  them to modulate the base model’s predictions as needed. To enable more rigorous
  evaluation of model editors, we introduce three challenging language model editing
  problems based on question answering, fact-checking, and dialogue generation. We
  find that only SERAC achieves high performance on all three problems, consistently
  outperforming existing approaches to model editing by a significant margin. Code,
  data, and additional project information will be made available at https://sites.google.com/view/serac-editing.'
