title: Forget-free Continual Learning with Winning Subnetworks
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Inspired by Lottery Ticket Hypothesis that competitive subnetworks exist
  within a dense network, we propose a continual learning method referred to as Winning
  SubNetworks (WSN), which sequentially learns and selects an optimal subnetwork for
  each task. Specifically, WSN jointly learns the model weights and task-adaptive
  binary masks pertaining to subnetworks associated with each task whilst attempting
  to select a small set of weights to be activated (winning ticket) by reusing weights
  of the prior subnetworks. The proposed method is inherently immune to catastrophic
  forgetting as each selected subnetwork model does not infringe upon other subnetworks.
  Binary masks spawned per winning ticket are encoded into one N-bit binary digit
  mask, then compressed using Huffman coding for a sub-linear increase in network
  capacity with respect to the number of tasks.
