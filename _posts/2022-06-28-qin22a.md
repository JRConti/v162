title: Generalizing to Evolving Domains with Latent Structure-Aware Sequential Autoencoder
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Domain generalization aims to improve the generalization capability of machine
  learning systems to out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Existing domain generalization
  techniques embark upon stationary and discrete environments to tackle the generalization
  issue caused by OOD data. However, many real-world tasks in non-stationary environments
  (e.g., self-driven car system, sensor measures) involve more complex and continuously
  evolving domain drift, which raises new challenges for the problem of domain generalization.
  In this paper, we formulate the aforementioned setting as the problem of evolving
  domain generalization. Specifically, we propose to introduce a probabilistic framework
  called Latent Structure-aware Sequential Autoencoder (LSSAE) to tackle the problem
  of evolving domain generalization via exploring the underlying continuous structure
  in the latent space of deep neural networks, where we aim to identify two major
  factors namely covariate shift and concept shift accounting for distribution shift
  in non-stationary environments. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world
  datasets show that LSSAE can lead to superior performances based on the evolving
  domain generalization setting.
