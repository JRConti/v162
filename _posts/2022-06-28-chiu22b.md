title: Discrete Probabilistic Inverse Optimal Transport
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Inverse Optimal Transport (IOT) studies the problem of inferring the underlying
  cost that gives rise to an observation on coupling two probability measures. Couplings
  appear as the outcome of matching sets (e.g. dating) and moving distributions (e.g.
  transportation). Compared to Optimal transport (OT), the mathematical theory of
  IOT is undeveloped. We formalize and systematically analyze the properties of IOT
  using tools from the study of entropy-regularized OT. Theoretical contributions
  include characterization of the manifold of cross-ratio equivalent costs, the implications
  of model priors, and derivation of an MCMC sampler. Empirical contributions include
  visualizations of cross-ratio equivalent effect on basic examples, simulations validating
  theoretical results and experiments on real world data.
