title: Contextual Information-Directed Sampling
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Information-directed sampling (IDS) has recently demonstrated its potential
  as a data-efficient reinforcement learning algorithm. However, it is still unclear
  what is the right form of information ratio to optimize when contextual information
  is available. We investigate the IDS design through two contextual bandit problems:
  contextual bandits with graph feedback and sparse linear contextual bandits. We
  provably demonstrate the advantage of <em>contextual IDS</em> over <em>conditional
  IDS</em> and emphasize the importance of considering the context distribution. The
  main message is that an intelligent agent should invest more on the actions that
  are beneficial for the future unseen contexts while the conditional IDS can be myopic.
  We further propose a computationally-efficient version of contextual IDS based on
  Actor-Critic and evaluate it empirically on a neural network contextual bandit.'
