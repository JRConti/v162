title: 'Bayesian Nonparametric Learning for Point Processes with Spatial Homogeneity:
  A Spatial Analysis of NBA Shot Locations'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Basketball shot location data provide valuable summary information regarding
  players to coaches, sports analysts, fans, statisticians, as well as players themselves.
  Represented by spatial points, such data are naturally analyzed with spatial point
  process models. We present a novel nonparametric Bayesian method for learning the
  underlying intensity surface built upon a combination of Dirichlet process and Markov
  random field. Our method has the advantage of effectively encouraging local spatial
  homogeneity when estimating a globally heterogeneous intensity surface. Posterior
  inferences are performed with an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm.
  Simulation studies show that the inferences are accurate and the method is superior
  compared to a wide range of competing methods. Application to the shot location
  data of $20$ representative NBA players in the 2017-2018 regular season offers interesting
  insights about the shooting patterns of these players. A comparison against the
  competing method shows that the proposed method can effectively incorporate spatial
  contiguity into the estimation of intensity surfaces.
