title: Active Multi-Task Representation Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: To leverage the power of big data from source domains and overcome the scarcity
  of target domain samples, representation learning based on multi-task pretraining
  has become a standard approach in many applications. However, large-scale pretraining
  is often computationally expensive and not affordable for small organizations. When
  there is only one target task, most source tasks can be irrelevant, and we can actively
  sample a subset of source data from the most To leverage the power of big data from
  source tasks and overcome the scarcity of the target task samples, representation
  learning based on multi-task pretraining has become a standard approach in many
  applications. However, up until now, choosing which source tasks to include in the
  multi-task learning has been more art than science. In this paper, we give the first
  formal study on resource task sampling by leveraging the techniques from active
  learning. We propose an algorithm that iteratively estimates the relevance of each
  source task to the target task and samples from each source task based on the estimated
  relevance. Theoretically, we show that for the linear representation class, to achieve
  the same error rate, our algorithm can save up to a textit{number of source tasks}
  factor in the source task sample complexity, compared with the naive uniform sampling
  from all source tasks. We also provide experiments on real-world computer vision
  datasets to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on both linear and
  convolutional neural network representation classes. We believe our paper serves
  as an important initial step to bring techniques from active learning to representation
  learning.
