title: Generating Distributional Adversarial Examples to Evade Statistical Detectors
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Deep neural networks (DNNs) are known to be highly vulnerable to adversarial
  examples (AEs) that include malicious perturbations. Assumptions about the statistical
  differences between natural and adversarial inputs are commonplace in many detection
  techniques. As a best practice, AE detectors are evaluated against ’adaptive’ attackers
  who actively perturb their inputs to avoid detection. Due to the difficulties in
  designing adaptive attacks, however, recent work suggests that most detectors have
  incomplete evaluation. We aim to fill this gap by designing a generic adaptive attack
  against detectors: the ’statistical indistinguishability attack’ (SIA). SIA optimizes
  a novel objective to craft adversarial examples (AEs) that follow the same distribution
  as the natural inputs with respect to DNN representations. Our objective targets
  all DNN layers simultaneously as we show that AEs being indistinguishable at one
  layer might fail to be so at other layers. SIA is formulated around evading distributional
  detectors that inspect a set of AEs as a whole and is also effective against four
  individual AE detectors, two dataset shift detectors, and an out-of-distribution
  sample detector, curated from published works. This suggests that SIA can be a reliable
  tool for evaluating the security of a range of detectors.'
