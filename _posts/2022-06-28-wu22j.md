title: 'DAVINZ: Data Valuation using Deep Neural Networks at Initialization'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Recent years have witnessed a surge of interest in developing trustworthy
  methods to evaluate the value of data in many real-world applications (e.g., collaborative
  machine learning, data marketplaces). Existing data valuation methods typically
  valuate data using the generalization performance of converged machine learning
  models after their long-term model training, hence making data valuation on large
  complex deep neural networks (DNNs) unaffordable. To this end, we theoretically
  derive a domain-aware generalization bound to estimate the generalization performance
  of DNNs without model training. We then exploit this theoretically derived generalization
  bound to develop a novel training-free data valuation method named data valuation
  at initialization (DAVINZ) on DNNs, which consistently achieves remarkable effectiveness
  and efficiency in practice. Moreover, our training-free DAVINZ, surprisingly, can
  even theoretically and empirically enjoy the desirable properties that training-based
  data valuation methods usually attain, thus making it more trustworthy in practice.
