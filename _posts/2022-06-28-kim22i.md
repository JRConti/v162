title: 'Soft Truncation: A Universal Training Technique of Score-based Diffusion Model
  for High Precision Score Estimation'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models bring state-of-the-art performance on
  image generation tasks. However, empirical results from previous research in diffusion
  models imply an inverse correlation between density estimation and sample generation
  performances. This paper investigates with sufficient empirical evidence that such
  inverse correlation happens because density estimation is significantly contributed
  by small diffusion time, whereas sample generation mainly depends on large diffusion
  time. However, training a score network well across the entire diffusion time is
  demanding because the loss scale is significantly imbalanced at each diffusion time.
  For successful training, therefore, we introduce Soft Truncation, a universally
  applicable training technique for diffusion models, that softens the fixed and static
  truncation hyperparameter into a random variable. In experiments, Soft Truncation
  achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CelebA, CelebA-HQ $256\times
  256$, and STL-10 datasets.
