title: Prototype Based Classification from Hierarchy to Fairness
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Artificial neural nets can represent and classify many types of high-dimensional
  data but are often tailored to particular applications – e.g., for “fair” or “hierarchical”
  classification. Once an architecture has been selected, it is often difficult for
  humans to adjust models for a new task; for example, a hierarchical classifier cannot
  be easily transformed into a fair classifier that shields a protected field. Our
  contribution in this work is a new neural network architecture, the concept subspace
  network (CSN), which generalizes existing specialized classifiers to produce a unified
  model capable of learning a spectrum of multi-concept relationships. We demonstrate
  that CSNs reproduce state-of-the-art results in fair classification when enforcing
  concept independence, may be transformed into hierarchical classifiers, or may even
  reconcile fairness and hierarchy within a single classifier. The CSN is inspired
  by and matches the performance of existing prototype-based classifiers that promote
  interpretability.
