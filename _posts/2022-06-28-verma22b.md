title: 'VarScene: A Deep Generative Model for Realistic Scene Graph Synthesis'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Scene graphs are powerful abstractions that capture relationships between
  objects in images by modeling objects as nodes and relationships as edges. Generation
  of realistic synthetic scene graphs has applications like scene synthesis and data
  augmentation for supervised learning. Existing graph generative models are predominantly
  targeted toward molecular graphs, leveraging the limited vocabulary of atoms and
  bonds and also the well-defined semantics of chemical compounds. In contrast, scene
  graphs have much larger object and relation vocabularies, and their semantics are
  latent. To address this challenge, we propose a variational autoencoder for scene
  graphs, which is optimized for the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) between the ground
  truth scene graph distribution and distribution of the generated scene graphs. Our
  method views a scene graph as a collection of star graphs and encodes it into a
  latent representation of the underlying stars. The decoder generates scene graphs
  by learning to sample the component stars and edges between them. Our experiments
  show that our method is able to mimic the underlying scene graph generative process
  more accurately than several state-of-the-art baselines.
