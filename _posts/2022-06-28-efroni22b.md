title: Sparsity in Partially Controllable Linear Systems
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: A fundamental concept in control theory is that of controllability, where
  any system state can be reached through an appropriate choice of control inputs.
  Indeed, a large body of classical and modern approaches are designed for controllable
  linear dynamical systems. However, in practice, we often encounter systems in which
  a large set of state variables evolve exogenously and independently of the control
  inputs; such systems are only partially controllable. The focus of this work is
  on a large class of partially controllable linear dynamical systems, specified by
  an underlying sparsity pattern. Our main results establish structural conditions
  and finite-sample guarantees for learning to control such systems. In particular,
  our structural results characterize those state variables which are irrelevant for
  optimal control, an analysis which departs from classical control techniques. Our
  algorithmic results adapt techniques from high-dimensional statistics{—}specifically
  soft-thresholding and semiparametric least-squares{—}to exploit the underlying sparsity
  pattern in order to obtain finite-sample guarantees that significantly improve over
  those based on certainty-equivalence. We also corroborate these theoretical improvements
  over certainty-equivalent control through a simulation study.
