title: 'AnyMorph: Learning Transferable Polices By Inferring Agent Morphology'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The prototypical approach to reinforcement learning involves training policies
  tailored to a particular agent from scratch for every new morphology. Recent work
  aims to eliminate the re-training of policies by investigating whether a morphology-agnostic
  policy, trained on a diverse set of agents with similar task objectives, can be
  transferred to new agents with unseen morphologies without re-training. This is
  a challenging problem that required previous approaches to use hand-designed descriptions
  of the new agent’s morphology. Instead of hand-designing this description, we propose
  a data-driven method that learns a representation of morphology directly from the
  reinforcement learning objective. Ours is the first reinforcement learning algorithm
  that can train a policy to generalize to new agent morphologies without requiring
  a description of the agent’s morphology in advance. We evaluate our approach on
  the standard benchmark for agent-agnostic control, and improve over the current
  state of the art in zero-shot generalization to new agents. Importantly, our method
  attains good performance without an explicit description of morphology.
