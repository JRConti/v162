title: 'ViT-NeT: Interpretable Vision Transformers with Neural Tree Decoder'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Vision transformers (ViTs), which have demonstrated a state-of-the-art performance
  in image classification, can also visualize global interpretations through attention-based
  contributions. However, the complexity of the model makes it difficult to interpret
  the decision-making process, and the ambiguity of the attention maps can cause incorrect
  correlations between image patches. In this study, we propose a new ViT neural tree
  decoder (ViT-NeT). A ViT acts as a backbone, and to solve its limitations, the output
  contextual image patches are applied to the proposed NeT. The NeT aims to accurately
  classify fine-grained objects with similar inter-class correlations and different
  intra-class correlations. In addition, it describes the decision-making process
  through a tree structure and prototype and enables a visual interpretation of the
  results. The proposed ViT-NeT is designed to not only improve the classification
  performance but also provide a human-friendly interpretation, which is effective
  in resolving the trade-off between performance and interpretability. We compared
  the performance of ViT-NeT with other state-of-art methods using widely used fine-grained
  visual categorization benchmark datasets and experimentally proved that the proposed
  method is superior in terms of the classification performance and interpretability.
