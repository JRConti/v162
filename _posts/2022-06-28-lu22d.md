title: Model-Free Opponent Shaping
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In general-sum games the interaction of self-interested learning agents
  commonly leads to collectively worst-case outcomes, such as defect-defect in the
  iterated prisoner’s dilemma (IPD). To overcome this, some methods, such as Learning
  with Opponent-Learning Awareness (LOLA), directly shape the learning process of
  their opponents. However, these methods are myopic since only a small number of
  steps can be anticipated, are asymmetric since they treat other agents as naive
  learners, and require the use of higher-order derivatives, which are calculated
  through white-box access to an opponent’s differentiable learning algorithm. To
  address these issues, we propose Model-Free Opponent Shaping (M-FOS). M-FOS learns
  in a meta-game in which each meta-step is an episode of the underlying game. The
  meta-state consists of the policies in the underlying game and the meta-policy produces
  a new policy to be used in the next episode. M-FOS then uses generic model-free
  optimisation methods to learn meta-policies that accomplish long-horizon opponent
  shaping. Empirically, M-FOS near-optimally exploits naive learners and other, more
  sophisticated algorithms from the literature. For example, to the best of our knowledge,
  it is the first method to learn the well-known ZD extortion strategy in the IPD.
  In the same settings, M-FOS leads to socially optimal outcomes under meta-self-play.
  Finally, we show that M-FOS can be scaled to high-dimensional settings.
