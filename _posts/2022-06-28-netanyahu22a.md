title: Discovering Generalizable Spatial Goal Representations via Graph-based Active
  Reward Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In this work, we consider one-shot imitation learning for object rearrangement
  tasks, where an AI agent needs to watch a single expert demonstration and learn
  to perform the same task in different environments. To achieve a strong generalization,
  the AI agent must infer the spatial goal specification for the task. However, there
  can be multiple goal specifications that fit the given demonstration. To address
  this, we propose a reward learning approach, Graph-based Equivalence Mappings (GEM),
  that can discover spatial goal representations that are aligned with the intended
  goal specification, enabling successful generalization in unseen environments. Specifically,
  GEM represents a spatial goal specification by a reward function conditioned on
  i) a graph indicating important spatial relationships between objects and ii) state
  equivalence mappings for each edge in the graph indicating invariant properties
  of the corresponding relationship. GEM combines inverse reinforcement learning and
  active reward learning to efficiently improve the reward function by utilizing the
  graph structure and domain randomization enabled by the equivalence mappings. We
  conducted experiments with simulated oracles and with human subjects. The results
  show that GEM can drastically improve the generalizability of the learned goal representations
  over strong baselines.
