title: Discriminator-Weighted Offline Imitation Learning from Suboptimal Demonstrations
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We study the problem of offline Imitation Learning (IL) where an agent aims
  to learn an optimal expert behavior policy without additional online environment
  interactions. Instead, the agent is provided with a other_files offline dataset
  from suboptimal behaviors. Prior works that address this problem either require
  that expert data occupies the majority proportion of the offline dataset, or need
  to learn a reward function and perform offline reinforcement learning (RL) afterwards.
  In this paper, we aim to address the problem without additional steps of reward
  learning and offline RL training for the case when demonstrations contain a large
  proportion of suboptimal data. Built upon behavioral cloning (BC), we introduce
  an additional discriminator to distinguish expert and non-expert data. We propose
  a cooperation framework to boost the learning of both tasks, Based on this framework,
  we design a new IL algorithm, where the outputs of the discriminator serve as the
  weights of the BC loss. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm achieves
  higher returns and faster training speed compared to baseline algorithms.
