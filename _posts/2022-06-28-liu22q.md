title: 'Kill a Bird with Two Stones: Closing the Convergence Gaps in Non-Strongly
  Convex Optimization by Directly Accelerated SVRG with Double Compensation and Snapshots'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Recently, some accelerated stochastic variance reduction algorithms such
  as Katyusha and ASVRG-ADMM achieve faster convergence than non-accelerated methods
  such as SVRG and SVRG-ADMM. However, there are still some gaps between the oracle
  complexities and their lower bounds. To fill in these gaps, this paper proposes
  a novel Directly Accelerated stochastic Variance reductIon (DAVIS) algorithm with
  two Snapshots for non-strongly convex (non-SC) unconstrained problems. Our theoretical
  results show that DAVIS achieves the optimal convergence rate O(1/(nS^2)) and optimal
  gradient complexity O(n+\sqrt{nL/\epsilon}), which is identical to its lower bound.
  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first directly accelerated algorithm that
  attains the optimal lower bound and improves the convergence rate from O(1/S^2)
  to O(1/(nS^2)). Moreover, we extend DAVIS and theoretical results to non-SC problems
  with a structured regularizer, and prove that the proposed algorithm with double-snapshots
  also attains the optimal convergence rate O(1/(nS)) and optimal oracle complexity
  O(n+L/\epsilon) for such problems, and it is at least a factor n/S faster than existing
  accelerated stochastic algorithms, where n\gg S in general.
