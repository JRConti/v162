  with Actor Rectification'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Conservatism has led to significant progress in offline reinforcement learning
  (RL) where an agent learns from pre-collected datasets. However, as many real-world
  scenarios involve interaction among multiple agents, it is important to resolve
  offline RL in the multi-agent setting. Given the recent success of transferring
  online RL algorithms to the multi-agent setting, one may expect that offline RL
  algorithms will also transfer to multi-agent settings directly. Surprisingly, we
  empirically observe that conservative offline RL algorithms do not work well in
  the multi-agent settingâ€”the performance degrades significantly with an increasing
  number of agents. Towards mitigating the degradation, we identify a key issue that
  non-concavity of the value function makes the policy gradient improvements prone
  to local optima. Multiple agents exacerbate the problem severely, since the suboptimal
  policy by any agent can lead to uncoordinated global failure. Following this intuition,
  we propose a simple yet effective method, Offline Multi-Agent RL with Actor Rectification
  (OMAR), which combines the first-order policy gradients and zeroth-order optimization
  methods to better optimize the conservative value functions over the actor parameters.
  Despite the simplicity, OMAR achieves state-of-the-art results in a variety of multi-agent
  control tasks.
