title: Continuous-Time Analysis of Accelerated Gradient Methods via Conservation Laws
  in Dilated Coordinate Systems
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We analyze continuous-time models of accelerated gradient methods through
  deriving conservation laws in dilated coordinate systems. Namely, instead of analyzing
  the dynamics of $X(t)$, we analyze the dynamics of $W(t)=t^\alpha(X(t)-X_c)$ for
  some $\alpha$ and $X_c$ and derive a conserved quantity, analogous to physical energy,
  in this dilated coordinate system. Through this methodology, we recover many known
  continuous-time analyses in a streamlined manner and obtain novel continuous-time
  analyses for OGM-G, an acceleration mechanism for efficiently reducing gradient
  magnitude that is distinct from that of Nesterov. Finally, we show that a semi-second-order
  symplectic Euler discretization in the dilated coordinate system leads to an $\mathcal{O}(1/k^2)$
  rate on the standard setup of smooth convex minimization, without any further assumptions
  such as infinite differentiability.
