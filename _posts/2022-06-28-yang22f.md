title: Searching for BurgerFormer with Micro-Meso-Macro Space Design
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: With the success of Transformers in the computer vision field, the automated
  design of vision Transformers has attracted significant attention. Recently, MetaFormer
  found that simple average pooling can achieve impressive performance, which naturally
  raises the question of how to design a search space to search diverse and high-performance
  Transformer-like architectures. By revisiting typical search spaces, we design micro-meso-macro
  space to search for Transformer-like architectures, namely BurgerFormer. Micro,
  meso, and macro correspond to the granularity levels of operation, block and stage,
  respectively. At the microscopic level, we enrich the atomic operations to include
  various normalizations, activation functions, and basic operations (e.g., multi-head
  self attention, average pooling). At the mesoscopic level, a hamburger structure
  is searched out as the basic BurgerFormer block. At the macroscopic level, we search
  for the depth, width, and expansion ratio of the network based on the multi-stage
  architecture. Meanwhile, we propose a hybrid sampling method for effectively training
  the supernet. Experimental results demonstrate that the searched BurgerFormer architectures
  achieve comparable even superior performance compared with current state-of-the-art
  Transformers on the ImageNet and COCO datasets. The codes can be available at https://github.com/xingxing-123/BurgerFormer.
