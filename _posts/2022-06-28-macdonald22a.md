title: 'Interpretable Neural Networks with Frank-Wolfe: Sparse Relevance Maps and
  Relevance Orderings'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We study the effects of constrained optimization formulations and Frank-Wolfe
  algorithms for obtaining interpretable neural network predictions. Reformulating
  the Rate-Distortion Explanations (RDE) method for relevance attribution as a constrained
  optimization problem provides precise control over the sparsity of relevance maps.
  This enables a novel multi-rate as well as a relevance-ordering variant of RDE that
  both empirically outperform standard RDE and other baseline methods in a well-established
  comparison test. We showcase several deterministic and stochastic variants of the
  Frank-Wolfe algorithm and their effectiveness for RDE.
