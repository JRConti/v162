abstract: Approximating distributions from their samples is a canonical statistical-learning
  problem. One of its most powerful and successful modalities approximates every distribution
  to an $\ell_1$ distance essentially at most a constant times larger than its closest
  $t$-piece degree-$d$ polynomial, where $t\ge1$ and $d\ge0$. Letting $c_{t,d}$ denote
  the smallest such factor, clearly $c_{1,0}=1$, and it can be shown that $c_{t,d}\ge
  2$ for all other $t$ and $d$. Yet current computationally efficient algorithms show
  only $c_{t,1}\le 2.25$ and the bound rises quickly to $c_{t,d}\le 3$ for $d\ge 9$.
  We derive a near-linear-time and essentially sample-optimal estimator that establishes
  $c_{t,d}=2$ for all $(t,d)\ne(1,0)$. Additionally, for many practical distributions,
  the lowest approximation distance is achieved by polynomials with vastly varying
  number of pieces. We provide a method that estimates this number near-optimally,
  hence helps approach the best possible approximation. Experiments combining the
  two techniques confirm improved performance over existing methodologies.
