title: 'Gating Dropout: Communication-efficient Regularization for Sparsely Activated
  Transformers'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Sparsely activated transformers, such as Mixture of Experts (MoE), have
  received great interest due to their outrageous scaling capability which enables
  dramatical increases in model size without significant increases in computational
  cost. To achieve this, MoE models replace the feedforward sub-layer with Mixture-of-Experts
  sub-layer in transformers and use a gating network to route each token to its assigned
  experts. Since the common practice for efficient training of such models requires
  distributing experts and tokens across different machines, this routing strategy
  often incurs huge cross-machine communication cost because tokens and their assigned
  experts likely reside in different machines. In this paper, we propose <em>Gating
  Dropout</em>, which allows tokens to ignore the gating network and stay at their
  local machines, thus reducing the cross-machine communication. Similar to traditional
  dropout, we also show that Gating Dropout has a regularization effect during training,
  resulting in improved generalization performance. We validate the effectiveness
  of Gating Dropout on multilingual machine translation tasks. Our results demonstrate
  that Gating Dropout improves a state-of-the-art MoE model with faster wall-clock
  time convergence rates and better BLEU scores for a variety of model sizes and datasets.
