title: Adaptive Best-of-Both-Worlds Algorithm for Heavy-Tailed Multi-Armed Bandits
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In this paper, we generalize the concept of heavy-tailed multi-armed bandits
  to adversarial environments, and develop robust best-of-both-worlds algorithms for
  heavy-tailed multi-armed bandits (MAB), where losses have $\alpha$-th ($1<\alpha\le
  2$) moments bounded by $\sigma^\alpha$, while the variances may not exist. Specifically,
  we design an algorithm \texttt{HTINF}, when the heavy-tail parameters $\alpha$ and
  $\sigma$ are known to the agent, \texttt{HTINF} simultaneously achieves the optimal
  regret for both stochastic and adversarial environments, without knowing the actual
  environment type a-priori. When $\alpha,\sigma$ are unknown, \texttt{HTINF} achieves
  a $\log T$-style instance-dependent regret in stochastic cases and $o(T)$ no-regret
  guarantee in adversarial cases. We further develop an algorithm \texttt{AdaTINF},
  achieving $\mathcal O(\sigma K^{1-\nicefrac 1\alpha}T^{\nicefrac{1}{\alpha}})$ minimax
  optimal regret even in adversarial settings, without prior knowledge on $\alpha$
  and $\sigma$. This result matches the known regret lower-bound (Bubeck et al., 2013),
  which assumed a stochastic environment and $\alpha$ and $\sigma$ are both known.
  To our knowledge, the proposed \texttt{HTINF} algorithm is the first to enjoy a
  best-of-both-worlds regret guarantee, and \texttt{AdaTINF} is the first algorithm
  that can adapt to both $\alpha$ and $\sigma$ to achieve optimal gap-indepedent regret
  bound in classical heavy-tailed stochastic MAB setting and our novel adversarial
  formulation.
