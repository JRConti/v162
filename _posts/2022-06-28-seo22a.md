title: Reinforcement Learning with Action-Free Pre-Training from Videos
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Recent unsupervised pre-training methods have shown to be effective on
  language and vision domains by learning useful representations for multiple downstream
  tasks. In this paper, we investigate if such unsupervised pre-training methods can
  also be effective for vision-based reinforcement learning (RL). To this end, we
  introduce a framework that learns representations useful for understanding the dynamics
  via generative pre-training on videos. Our framework consists of two phases: we
  pre-train an action-free latent video prediction model, and then utilize the pre-trained
  representations for efficiently learning action-conditional world models on unseen
  environments. To incorporate additional action inputs during fine-tuning, we introduce
  a new architecture that stacks an action-conditional latent prediction model on
  top of the pre-trained action-free prediction model. Moreover, for better exploration,
  we propose a video-based intrinsic bonus that leverages pre-trained representations.
  We demonstrate that our framework significantly improves both final performances
  and sample-efficiency of vision-based RL in a variety of manipulation and locomotion
  tasks. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/younggyoseo/apv}.'
