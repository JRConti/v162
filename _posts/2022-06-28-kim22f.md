title: 'Fisher SAM: Information Geometry and Sharpness Aware Minimisation'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Recent sharpness-aware minimisation (SAM) is known to find flat minima which
  is beneficial for better generalisation with improved robustness. SAM essentially
  modifies the loss function by the maximum loss value within the small neighborhood
  around the current iterate. However, it uses the Euclidean ball to define the neighborhood,
  which can be less accurate since loss functions for neural networks are typically
  defined over probability distributions (e.g., class predictive probabilities), rendering
  the parameter space no more Euclidean. In this paper we consider the information
  geometry of the model parameter space when defining the neighborhood, namely replacing
  SAMâ€™s Euclidean balls with ellipsoids induced by the Fisher information. Our approach,
  dubbed Fisher SAM, defines more accurate neighborhood structures that conform to
  the intrinsic metric of the underlying statistical manifold. For instance, SAM may
  probe the worst-case loss value at either a too nearby or inappropriately distant
  point due to the ignorance of the parameter space geometry, which is avoided by
  our Fisher SAM. Another recent Adaptive SAM approach that stretches/shrinks the
  Euclidean ball in accordance with the scales of the parameter magnitudes, might
  be dangerous, potentially destroying the neighborhood structure even severely. We
  demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed Fisher SAM on several benchmark
  datasets/tasks.
