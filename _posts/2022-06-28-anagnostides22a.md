title: On Last-Iterate Convergence Beyond Zero-Sum Games
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Most existing results about last-iterate convergence of learning dynamics
  are limited to two-player zero-sum games, and only apply under rigid assumptions
  about what dynamics the players follow. In this paper we provide new results and
  techniques that apply to broader families of games and learning dynamics. First,
  we show that in a class of games that includes constant-sum polymatrix and strategically
  zero-sum games, the trajectories of dynamics such as optimistic mirror descent (OMD)
  exhibit a boundedness property, which holds even when players employ different algorithms
  and prediction mechanisms. This property enables us to obtain $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ rates
  and optimal $O(1)$ regret bounds. Our analysis also reveals a surprising property:
  OMD either reaches arbitrarily close to a Nash equilibrium or it outperforms the
  robust price of anarchy in efficiency. Moreover, for potential games we establish
  convergence to an $\epsilon$-equilibrium after $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ iterations for
  mirror descent under a broad class of regularizers, as well as optimal $O(1)$ regret
  bounds for OMD variants. Our framework also extends to near-potential games, and
  unifies known analyses for distributed learning in Fisherâ€™s market model. Finally,
  we analyze the convergence, efficiency, and robustness of optimistic gradient descent
  (OGD) in general-sum continuous games.'
