title: Batched Dueling Bandits
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'The K-armed dueling bandit problem, where the feedback is in the form of
  noisy pairwise comparisons, has been widely studied. Previous works have only focused
  on the sequential setting where the policy adapts after every comparison. However,
  in many applications such as search ranking and recommendation systems, it is preferable
  to perform comparisons in a limited number of parallel batches. We study the batched
  K-armed dueling bandit problem under two standard settings: (i) existence of a Condorcet
  winner, and (ii) strong stochastic transitivity and stochastic triangle inequality.
  For both settings, we obtain algorithms with a smooth trade-off between the number
  of batches and regret. Our regret bounds match the best known sequential regret
  bounds (up to poly-logarithmic factors), using only a logarithmic number of batches.
  We complement our regret analysis with a nearly-matching lower bound. Finally, we
  also validate our theoretical results via experiments on synthetic and real data.'
