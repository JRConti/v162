title: 'MetAug: Contrastive Learning via Meta Feature Augmentation'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: What matters for contrastive learning? We argue that contrastive learning
  heavily relies on informative features, or “hard” (positive or negative) features.
  Early works include more informative features by applying complex data augmentations
  and large batch size or memory bank, and recent works design elaborate sampling
  approaches to explore informative features. The key challenge toward exploring such
  features is that the source multi-view data is generated by applying random data
  augmentations, making it infeasible to always add useful information in the augmented
  data. Consequently, the informativeness of features learned from such augmented
  data is limited. In response, we propose to directly augment the features in latent
  space, thereby learning discriminative representations without a large amount of
  input data. We perform a meta learning technique to build the augmentation generator
  that updates its network parameters by considering the performance of the encoder.
  However, insufficient input data may lead the encoder to learn collapsed features
  and therefore malfunction the augmentation generator. A new margin-injected regularization
  is further added in the objective function to avoid the encoder learning a degenerate
  mapping. To contrast all features in one gradient back-propagation step, we adopt
  the proposed optimization-driven unified contrastive loss instead of the conventional
  contrastive loss. Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art results on several
  benchmark datasets.
