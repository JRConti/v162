title: Channel Importance Matters in Few-Shot Image Classification
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Few-Shot Learning (FSL) requires vision models to quickly adapt to brand-new
  classification tasks with a shift in task distribution. Understanding the difficulties
  posed by this task distribution shift is central to FSL. In this paper, we show
  that a simple channel-wise feature transformation may be the key to unraveling this
  secret from a channel perspective. When facing novel few-shot tasks in the test-time
  datasets, this transformation can greatly improve the generalization ability of
  learned image representations, while being agnostic to the choice of datasets and
  training algorithms. Through an in-depth analysis of this transformation, we find
  that the difficulty of representation transfer in FSL stems from the severe channel
  bias problem of image representations: channels may have different importance in
  different tasks, while convolutional neural networks are likely to be insensitive,
  or respond incorrectly to such a shift. This points out a core problem of the generalization
  ability of modern vision systems which needs further attention in the future.'
