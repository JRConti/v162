abstract: 'Permutation invariant neural networks are a promising tool for predictive
  modeling of set data. We show, however, that existing architectures struggle to
  perform well when they are deep. In this work, we mathematically and empirically
  analyze normalization layers and residual connections in the context of deep permutation
  invariant neural networks. We develop set norm, a normalization tailored for sets,
  and introduce the “clean path principle” for equivariant residual connections alongside
  a novel benefit of such connections, the reduction of information loss. Based on
  our analysis, we propose Deep Sets++ and Set Transformer++, deep models that reach
  comparable or better performance than their original counterparts on a diverse suite
  of tasks. We additionally introduce Flow-RBC, a new single-cell dataset and real-world
  application of permutation invariant prediction. We open-source our data and code
  here: https://github.com/rajesh-lab/deep_permutation_invariant.'
