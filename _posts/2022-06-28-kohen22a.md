title: Transfer Learning In Differential Privacy’s Hybrid-Model
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The <em>hybrid-model</em> (Avent et al 2017) in Differential Privacy is
  a an augmentation of the local-model where in addition to $N$ local-agents we are
  assisted by one special agent who is in fact a curator holding the sensitive details
  of $n$ additional individuals. Here we study the problem of machine learning in
  the hybrid-model where the $n$ individuals in the curator’s dataset are drawn from
  a <em>different</em> distribution than the one of the general population (the local-agents).
  We give a general scheme – Subsample-Test-Reweigh – for this <em>transfer learning</em>
  problem, which reduces any curator-model learner to a learner in the hybrid-model
  using iterative subsampling and reweighing of the $n$ examples held by the curator
  based on a smooth variation (introduced by Bun et al 2020) of the Multiplicative-Weights
  algorithm. Our scheme has a sample complexity which relies on the $\chi^2$-divergence
  between the two distributions. We give worst-case analysis bounds on the sample
  complexity required for our private reduction. Aiming to reduce said sample complexity,
  we give two specific instances our sample complexity can be drastically reduced
  (one instance is analyzed mathematically, while the other - empirically) and pose
  several directions for follow-up work.
