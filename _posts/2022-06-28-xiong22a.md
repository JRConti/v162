title: Efficient Computation of Higher-Order Subgraph Attribution via Message Passing
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Explaining graph neural networks (GNNs) has become more and more important
  recently. Higher-order interpretation schemes, such as GNN-LRP (layer-wise relevance
  propagation for GNN), emerged as powerful tools for unraveling how different features
  interact thereby contributing to explaining GNNs. GNN-LRP gives a relevance attribution
  of walks between nodes at each layer, and the subgraph attribution is expressed
  as a sum over exponentially many such walks. In this work, we demonstrate that such
  exponential complexity can be avoided. In particular, we propose novel algorithms
  that enable to attribute subgraphs with GNN-LRP in linear-time (w.r.t. the network
  depth). Our algorithms are derived via message passing techniques that make use
  of the distributive property, thereby directly computing quantities for higher-order
  explanations. We further adapt our efficient algorithms to compute a generalization
  of subgraph attributions that also takes into account the neighboring graph features.
  Experimental results show the significant acceleration of the proposed algorithms
  and demonstrate the high usefulness and scalability of our novel generalized subgraph
  attribution method.
