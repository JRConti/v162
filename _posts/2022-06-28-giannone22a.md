title: 'SCHA-VAE: Hierarchical Context Aggregation for Few-Shot Generation'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: A few-shot generative model should be able to generate data from a novel
  distribution by only observing a limited set of examples. In few-shot learning the
  model is trained on data from many sets from distributions sharing some underlying
  properties such as sets of characters from different alphabets or objects from different
  categories. We extend current latent variable models for sets to a fully hierarchical
  approach with an attention-based point to set-level aggregation and call our method
  SCHA-VAE for Set-Context-Hierarchical-Aggregation Variational Autoencoder. We explore
  likelihood-based model comparison, iterative data sampling, and adaptation-free
  out-of-distribution generalization. Our results show that the hierarchical formulation
  better captures the intrinsic variability within the sets in the small data regime.
  This work generalizes deep latent variable approaches to few-shot learning, taking
  a step toward large-scale few-shot generation with a formulation that readily works
  with current state-of-the-art deep generative models.
