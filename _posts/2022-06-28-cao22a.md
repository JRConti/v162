  Sampling
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We propose a model-agnostic randomized learning framework based on Random
  Hypothesis Subspace Sampling (RHSS). Given any hypothesis class, it randomly samples
  $k$ hypotheses and learns a near-optimal model from their span by simply solving
  a linear least square problem in $O(n k^2)$ time, where $n$ is the number of training
  instances. On the theory side, we derive the performance guarantee of RHSS from
  a generic subspace approximation perspective, leveraging properties of metric entropy
  and random matrices. On the practical side, we apply the RHSS framework to learn
  kernel, network and tree based models. Experimental results show they converge efficiently
  as $k$ increases and outperform their model-specific counterparts including random
  Fourier feature, random vector functional link and extra tree on real-world data
  sets.
