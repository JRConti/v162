title: Popular decision tree algorithms are provably noise tolerant
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Using the framework of boosting, we prove that all impurity-based decision
  tree learning algorithms, including the classic ID3, C4.5, and CART, are highly
  noise tolerant. Our guarantees hold under the strongest noise model of nasty noise,
  and we provide near-matching upper and lower bounds on the allowable noise rate.
  We further show that these algorithms, which are simple and have long been central
  to everyday machine learning, enjoy provable guarantees in the noisy setting that
  are unmatched by existing algorithms in the theoretical literature on decision tree
  learning. Taken together, our results add to an ongoing line of research that seeks
  to place the empirical success of these practical decision tree algorithms on firm
  theoretical footing.
