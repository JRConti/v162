title: 'Contextual Bandits with Large Action Spaces: Made Practical'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: A central problem in sequential decision making is to develop algorithms
  that are practical and computationally efficient, yet support the use of flexible,
  general-purpose models. Focusing on the contextual bandit problem, recent progress
  provides provably efficient algorithms with strong empirical performance when the
  number of possible alternatives (“actions”) is small, but guarantees for decision
  making in large, continuous action spaces have remained elusive, leading to a significant
  gap between theory and practice. We present the first efficient, general-purpose
  algorithm for contextual bandits with continuous, linearly structured action spaces.
  Our algorithm makes use of computational oracles for (i) supervised learning, and
  (ii) optimization over the action space, and achieves sample complexity, runtime,
  and memory independent of the size of the action space. In addition, it is simple
  and practical. We perform a large-scale empirical evaluation, and show that our
  approach typically enjoys superior performance and efficiency compared to standard
  baselines.
