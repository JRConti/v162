title: Nonparametric Involutive Markov Chain Monte Carlo
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: A challenging problem in probabilistic programming is to develop inference
  algorithms that work for arbitrary programs in a universal probabilistic programming
  language (PPL). We present the nonparametric involutive Markov chain Monte Carlo
  (NP-iMCMC) algorithm as a method for constructing MCMC inference algorithms for
  nonparametric models expressible in universal PPLs. Building on the unifying involutive
  MCMC framework, and by providing a general procedure for driving state movement
  between dimensions, we show that NP-iMCMC can generalise numerous existing iMCMC
  algorithms to work on nonparametric models. We prove the correctness of the NP-iMCMC
  sampler. Our empirical study shows that the existing strengths of several iMCMC
  algorithms carry over to their nonparametric extensions. Applying our method to
  the recently proposed Nonparametric HMC, an instance of (Multiple Step) NP-iMCMC,
  we have constructed several nonparametric extensions (all of which new) that exhibit
  significant performance improvements.
