title: 'SpeqNets: Sparsity-aware permutation-equivariant graph networks'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: While message-passing graph neural networks have clear limitations in approximating
  permutation-equivariant functions over graphs or general relational data, more expressive,
  higher-order graph neural networks do not scale to large graphs. They either operate
  on $k$-order tensors or consider all $k$-node subgraphs, implying an exponential
  dependence on $k$ in memory requirements, and do not adapt to the sparsity of the
  graph. By introducing new heuristics for the graph isomorphism problem, we devise
  a class of universal, permutation-equivariant graph networks, which, unlike previous
  architectures, offer a fine-grained control between expressivity and scalability
  and adapt to the sparsity of the graph. These architectures lead to vastly reduced
  computation times compared to standard higher-order graph networks in the supervised
  node- and graph-level classification and regression regime while significantly improving
  standard graph neural network and graph kernel architectures in terms of predictive
  performance.
