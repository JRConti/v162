title: 'ButterflyFlow: Building Invertible Layers with Butterfly Matrices'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Normalizing flows model complex probability distributions using maps obtained
  by composing invertible layers. Special linear layers such as masked and 1{\texttimes}1
  convolutions play a key role in existing architectures because they increase expressive
  power while having tractable Jacobians and inverses. We propose a new family of
  invertible linear layers based on butterfly layers, which are known to theoretically
  capture complex linear structures including permutations and periodicity, yet can
  be inverted efficiently. This representational power is a key advantage of our approach,
  as such structures are common in many real-world datasets. Based on our invertible
  butterfly layers, we construct a new class of normalizing flow mod- els called ButterflyFlow.
  Empirically, we demonstrate that ButterflyFlows not only achieve strong density
  estimation results on natural images such as MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet-32{\texttimes}32,
  but also obtain significantly better log-likelihoods on structured datasets such
  as galaxy images and MIMIC-III patient cohorts{â€”}all while being more efficient
  in terms of memory and computation than relevant baselines.
