title: Cooperative Online Learning in Stochastic and Adversarial MDPs
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'We study cooperative online learning in stochastic and adversarial Markov
  decision process (MDP). That is, in each episode, $m$ agents interact with an MDP
  simultaneously and share information in order to minimize their individual regret.
  We consider environments with two types of randomness: <em>fresh</em> – where each
  agent’s trajectory is sampled i.i.d, and <em>non-fresh</em> – where the realization
  is shared by all agents (but each agent’s trajectory is also affected by its own
  actions). More precisely, with non-fresh randomness the realization of every cost
  and transition is fixed at the start of each episode, and agents that take the same
  action in the same state at the same time observe the same cost and next state.
  We thoroughly analyze all relevant settings, highlight the challenges and differences
  between the models, and prove nearly-matching regret lower and upper bounds. To
  our knowledge, we are the first to consider cooperative reinforcement learning (RL)
  with either non-fresh randomness or in adversarial MDPs.'
