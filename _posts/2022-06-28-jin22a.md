title: Antibody-Antigen Docking and Design via Hierarchical Structure Refinement
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Computational antibody design seeks to automatically create an antibody
  that binds to an antigen. The binding affinity is governed by the 3D binding interface
  where antibody residues (paratope) closely interact with antigen residues (epitope).
  Thus, the key question of antibody design is how to predict the 3D paratope-epitope
  complex (i.e., docking) for paratope generation. In this paper, we propose a new
  model called Hierarchical Structure Refinement Network (HSRN) for paratope docking
  and design. During docking, HSRN employs a hierarchical message passing network
  to predict atomic forces and use them to refine a binding complex in an iterative,
  equivariant manner. During generation, its autoregressive decoder progressively
  docks generated paratopes and builds a geometric representation of the binding interface
  to guide the next residue choice. Our results show that HSRN significantly outperforms
  prior state-of-the-art on paratope docking and design benchmarks.
