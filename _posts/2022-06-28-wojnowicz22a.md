title: Easy Variational Inference for Categorical Models via an Independent Binary
  Approximation
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We pursue tractable Bayesian analysis of generalized linear models (GLMs)
  for categorical data. GLMs have been difficult to scale to more than a few dozen
  categories due to non-conjugacy or strong posterior dependencies when using conjugate
  auxiliary variable methods. We define a new class of GLMs for categorical data called
  categorical-from-binary (CB) models. Each CB model has a likelihood that is bounded
  by the product of binary likelihoods, suggesting a natural posterior approximation.
  This approximation makes inference straightforward and fast; using well-known auxiliary
  variables for probit or logistic regression, the product of binary models admits
  conjugate closed-form variational inference that is embarrassingly parallel across
  categories and invariant to category ordering. Moreover, an independent binary model
  simultaneously approximates multiple CB models. Bayesian model averaging over these
  can improve the quality of the approximation for any given dataset. We show that
  our approach scales to thousands of categories, outperforming posterior estimation
  competitors like Automatic Differentiation Variational Inference (ADVI) and No U-Turn
  Sampling (NUTS) in the time required to achieve fixed prediction quality.
