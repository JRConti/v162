title: A Tree-based Model Averaging Approach for Personalized Treatment Effect Estimation
  from Heterogeneous Data Sources
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Accurately estimating personalized treatment effects within a study site
  (e.g., a hospital) has been challenging due to limited sample size. Furthermore,
  privacy considerations and lack of resources prevent a site from leveraging subject-level
  data from other sites. We propose a tree-based model averaging approach to improve
  the estimation accuracy of conditional average treatment effects (CATE) at a target
  site by leveraging models derived from other potentially heterogeneous sites, without
  them sharing subject-level data. To our best knowledge, there is no established
  model averaging approach for distributed data with a focus on improving the estimation
  of treatment effects. Specifically, under distributed data networks, our framework
  provides an interpretable tree-based ensemble of CATE estimators that joins models
  across study sites, while actively modeling the heterogeneity in data sources through
  site partitioning. The performance of this approach is demonstrated by a real-world
  study of the causal effects of oxygen therapy on hospital survival rate and backed
  up by comprehensive simulation results.
