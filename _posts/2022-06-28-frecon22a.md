booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We present a framework based on bilevel optimization for learning multilayer,
  deep data representations. On the one hand, the lower-level problem finds a representation
  by successively minimizing layer-wise objectives made of the sum of a prescribed
  regularizer as well as a fidelity term and some linear function both depending on
  the representation found at the previous layer. On the other hand, the upper-level
  problem optimizes over the linear functions to yield a linearly separable final
  representation. We show that, by choosing the fidelity term as the quadratic distance
  between two successive layer-wise representations, the bilevel problem reduces to
  the training of a feed-forward neural network. Instead, by elaborating on Bregman
  distances, we devise a novel neural network architecture additionally involving
  the inverse of the activation function reminiscent of the skip connection used in
  ResNets. Numerical experiments suggest that the proposed Bregman variant benefits
  from better learning properties and more robust prediction performance.
