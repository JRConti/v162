abstract: From the sampling of data to the initialisation of parameters, randomness
  is ubiquitous in modern Machine Learning practice. Understanding the statistical
  fluctuations engendered by the different sources of randomness in prediction is
  therefore key to understanding robust generalisation. In this manuscript we develop
  a quantitative and rigorous theory for the study of fluctuations in an ensemble
  of generalised linear models trained on different, but correlated, features in high-dimensions.
  In particular, we provide a complete description of the asymptotic joint distribution
  of the empirical risk minimiser for generic convex loss and regularisation in the
  high-dimensional limit. Our result encompasses a rich set of classification and
  regression tasks, such as the lazy regime of overparametrised neural networks, or
  equivalently the random features approximation of kernels. While allowing to study
  directly the mitigating effect of ensembling (or bagging) on the bias-variance decomposition
  of the test error, our analysis also helps disentangle the contribution of statistical
  fluctuations, and the singular role played by the interpolation threshold that are
  at the roots of the “double-descent” phenomenon.
