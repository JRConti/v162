booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Few-shot classification (FSC) requires training models using a few (typically
  one to five) data points per class. Meta-learning has proven to be able to learn
  a parametrized model for FSC by training on various other classification tasks.
  In this work, we propose PLATINUM (semi-suPervised modeL Agnostic meTa learnIng
  usiNg sUbmodular Mutual information ), a novel semi-supervised model agnostic meta
  learning framework that uses the submodular mutual in- formation (SMI) functions
  to boost the perfor- mance of FSC. PLATINUM leverages unlabeled data in the inner
  and outer loop using SMI func- tions during meta-training and obtains richer meta-
  learned parameterizations. We study the per- formance of PLATINUM in two scenarios
  - 1) where the unlabeled data points belong to the same set of classes as the labeled
  set of a cer- tain episode, and 2) where there exist out-of- distribution classes
  that do not belong to the la- beled set. We evaluate our method on various settings
  on the miniImageNet, tieredImageNet and CIFAR-FS datasets. Our experiments show
  that PLATINUM outperforms MAML and semi- supervised approaches like pseduo-labeling
  for semi-supervised FSC, especially for small ratio of labeled to unlabeled samples.
