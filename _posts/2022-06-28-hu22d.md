title: On the Role of Discount Factor in Offline Reinforcement Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables effective learning from previously
  collected data without exploration, which shows great promise in real-world applications
  when exploration is expensive or even infeasible. The discount factor, $\gamma$,
  plays a vital role in improving online RL sample efficiency and estimation accuracy,
  but the role of the discount factor in offline RL is not well explored. This paper
  examines two distinct effects of $\gamma$ in offline RL with theoretical analysis,
  namely the regularization effect and the pessimism effect. On the one hand, $\gamma$
  is a regulator to trade-off optimality with sample efficiency upon existing offline
  techniques. On the other hand, lower guidance $\gamma$ can also be seen as a way
  of pessimism where we optimize the policyâ€™s performance in the worst possible models.
  We empirically verify the above theoretical observation with tabular MDPs and standard
  D4RL tasks. The results show that the discount factor plays an essential role in
  the performance of offline RL algorithms, both under small data regimes upon existing
  offline methods and in large data regimes without other conservative methods.
