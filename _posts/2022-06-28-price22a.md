title: Hardness and Algorithms for Robust and Sparse Optimization
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We explore algorithms and limitations for sparse optimization problems such
  as sparse linear regression and robust linear regression. The goal of the sparse
  linear regression problem is to identify a small number of key features, while the
  goal of the robust linear regression problem is to identify a small number of erroneous
  measurements. Specifically, the sparse linear regression problem seeks a $k$-sparse
  vector $x\in\mathbb{R}^d$ to minimize $\|Ax-b\|_2$, given an input matrix $A\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times
  d}$ and a target vector $b\in\mathbb{R}^n$, while the robust linear regression problem
  seeks a set $S$ that ignores at most $k$ rows and a vector $x$ to minimize $\|(Ax-b)_S\|_2$.
  We first show bicriteria, NP-hardness of approximation for robust regression building
  on the work of \cite{ODonnellWZ15} which implies a similar result for sparse regression.
  We further show fine-grained hardness of robust regression through a reduction from
  the minimum-weight $k$-clique conjecture. On the positive side, we give an algorithm
  for robust regression that achieves arbitrarily accurate additive error and uses
  runtime that closely matches the lower bound from the fine-grained hardness result,
  as well as an algorithm for sparse regression with similar runtime. Both our upper
  and lower bounds rely on a general reduction from robust linear regression to sparse
  regression that we introduce. Our algorithms, inspired by the 3SUM problem, use
  approximate nearest neighbor data structures and may be of independent interest
  for solving sparse optimization problems. For instance, we demonstrate that our
  techniques can also be used for the well-studied sparse PCA problem.
