title: Improved No-Regret Algorithms for Stochastic Shortest Path with Linear MDP
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We introduce two new no-regret algorithms for the stochastic shortest path
  (SSP) problem with a linear MDP that significantly improve over the only existing
  results of (Vial et al., 2021). Our first algorithm is computationally efficient
  and achieves a regret bound $O(\sqrt{d^3B_{\star}^2T_{\star} K})$, where $d$ is
  the dimension of the feature space, $B_{\star}$ and $T_{\star}$ are upper bounds
  of the expected costs and hitting time of the optimal policy respectively, and $K$
  is the number of episodes. The same algorithm with a slight modification also achieves
  logarithmic regret of order $O(\frac{d^3B_{\star}^4}{c_{\min}^2\text{\rm gap}_{\min}
  }\ln^5\frac{dB_{\star} K}{c_{\min}})$, where $\text{\rm gap}_{\min}$ is the minimum
  sub-optimality gap and $c_{\min}$ is the minimum cost over all state-action pairs.
  Our result is obtained by developing a simpler and improved analysis for the finite-horizon
  approximation of (Cohen et al., 2021) with a smaller approximation error, which
  might be of independent interest. On the other hand, using variance-aware confidence
  sets in a global optimization problem, our second algorithm is computationally inefficient
  but achieves the first “horizon-free” regret bound $O(d^{3.5}B_{\star}\sqrt{K})$
  with no polynomial dependency on $T_{\star}$ or $1/c_{\min}$, almost matching the
  $\Omega(dB_{\star}\sqrt{K})$ lower bound from (Min et al., 2021).
