title: Actor-Critic based Improper Reinforcement Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'We consider an improper reinforcement learning setting where a learner
  is given $M$ base controllers for an unknown Markov decision process, and wishes
  to combine them optimally to produce a potentially new controller that can outperform
  each of the base ones. This can be useful in tuning across controllers, learnt possibly
  in mismatched or simulated environments, to obtain a good controller for a given
  target environment with relatively few trials. Towards this, we propose two algorithms:
  (1) a Policy Gradient-based approach; and (2) an algorithm that can switch between
  a simple Actor-Critic (AC) based scheme and a Natural Actor-Critic (NAC) scheme
  depending on the available information. Both algorithms operate over a class of
  improper mixtures of the given controllers. For the first case, we derive convergence
  rate guarantees assuming access to a gradient oracle. For the AC-based approach
  we provide convergence rate guarantees to a stationary point in the basic AC case
  and to a global optimum in the NAC case. Numerical results on (i) the standard control
  theoretic benchmark of stabilizing an inverted pendulum; and (ii) a constrained
  queueing task show that our improper policy optimization algorithm can stabilize
  the system even when the base policies at its disposal are unstable.'
