title: De novo mass spectrometry peptide sequencing with a transformer model
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Tandem mass spectrometry is the only high-throughput method for analyzing
  the protein content of complex biological samples and is thus the primary technology
  driving the growth of the field of proteomics. A key outstanding challenge in this
  field involves identifying the sequence of amino acids -the peptide- responsible
  for generating each observed spectrum, without making use of prior knowledge in
  the form of a peptide sequence database. Although various machine learning methods
  have been developed to address this de novo sequencing problem, challenges that
  arise when modeling tandem mass spectra have led to complex models that combine
  multiple neural networks and post-processing steps. We propose a simple yet powerful
  method for de novo peptide sequencing, Casanovo, that uses a transformer framework
  to map directly from a sequence of observed peaks (a mass spectrum) to a sequence
  of amino acids (a peptide). Our experiments show that Casanovo achieves state-of-the-art
  performance on a benchmark dataset using a standard cross-species evaluation framework
  which involves testing with spectra with never-before-seen peptide labels. Casanovo
  not only achieves superior performance but does so at a fraction of the model complexity
  and inference time required by other methods.
