title: 'TAM: Topology-Aware Margin Loss for Class-Imbalanced Node Classification'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Learning unbiased node representations under class-imbalanced graph data
  is challenging due to interactions between adjacent nodes. Existing studies have
  in common that they compensate the minor class nodes ‘as a group’ according to their
  overall quantity (ignoring node connections in graph), which inevitably increase
  the false positive cases for major nodes. We hypothesize that the increase in these
  false positive cases is highly affected by the label distribution around each node
  and confirm it experimentally. In addition, in order to handle this issue, we propose
  Topology-Aware Margin (TAM) to reflect local topology on the learning objective.
  Our method compares the connectivity pattern of each node with the class-averaged
  counter-part and adaptively adjusts the margin accordingly based on that. Our method
  consistently exhibits superiority over the baselines on various node classification
  benchmark datasets with representative GNN architectures.
