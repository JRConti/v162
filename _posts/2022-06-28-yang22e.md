title: Unsupervised Time-Series Representation Learning with Iterative Bilinear Temporal-Spectral
  Fusion
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Unsupervised/self-supervised time series representation learning is a challenging
  problem because of its complex dynamics and sparse annotations. Existing works mainly
  adopt the framework of contrastive learning with the time-based augmentation techniques
  to sample positives and negatives for contrastive training. Nevertheless, they mostly
  use segment-level augmentation derived from time slicing, which may bring about
  sampling bias and incorrect optimization with false negatives due to the loss of
  global context. Besides, they all pay no attention to incorporate the spectral information
  in feature representation. In this paper, we propose a unified framework, namely
  Bilinear Temporal-Spectral Fusion (BTSF). Specifically, we firstly utilize the instance-level
  augmentation with a simple dropout on the entire time series for maximally capturing
  long-term dependencies. We devise a novel iterative bilinear temporal-spectral fusion
  to explicitly encode the affinities of abundant time-frequency pairs, and iteratively
  refines representations in a fusion-and-squeeze manner with Spectrum-to-Time (S2T)
  and Time-to-Spectrum (T2S) Aggregation modules. We firstly conducts downstream evaluations
  on three major tasks for time series including classification, forecasting and anomaly
  detection. Experimental results shows that our BTSF consistently significantly outperforms
  the state-of-the-art methods.
