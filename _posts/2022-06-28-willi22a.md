title: 'COLA: Consistent Learning with Opponent-Learning Awareness'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Learning in general-sum games is unstable and frequently leads to socially
  undesirable (Pareto-dominated) outcomes. To mitigate this, Learning with Opponent-Learning
  Awareness (LOLA) introduced opponent shaping to this setting, by accounting for
  each agent’s influence on their opponents’ anticipated learning steps. However,
  the original LOLA formulation (and follow-up work) is inconsistent because LOLA
  models other agents as naive learners rather than LOLA agents. In previous work,
  this inconsistency was suggested as a cause of LOLA’s failure to preserve stable
  fixed points (SFPs). First, we formalize consistency and show that higher-order
  LOLA (HOLA) solves LOLA’s inconsistency problem if it converges. Second, we correct
  a claim made in the literature by Sch{ä}fer and Anandkumar (2019), proving that
  Competitive Gradient Descent (CGD) does not recover HOLA as a series expansion (and
  fails to solve the consistency problem). Third, we propose a new method called Consistent
  LOLA (COLA), which learns update functions that are consistent under mutual opponent
  shaping. It requires no more than second-order derivatives and learns consistent
  update functions even when HOLA fails to converge. However, we also prove that even
  consistent update functions do not preserve SFPs, contradicting the hypothesis that
  this shortcoming is caused by LOLA’s inconsistency. Finally, in an empirical evaluation
  on a set of general-sum games, we find that COLA finds prosocial solutions and that
  it converges under a wider range of learning rates than HOLA and LOLA. We support
  the latter finding with a theoretical result for a simple game.
