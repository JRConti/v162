title: Convergence of Invariant Graph Networks
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Although theoretical properties such as expressive power and over-smoothing
  of graph neural networks (GNN) have been extensively studied recently, its convergence
  property is a relatively new direction. In this paper, we investigate the convergence
  of one powerful GNN, Invariant Graph Network (IGN) over graphs sampled from graphons.
  We first prove the stability of linear layers for general $k$-IGN (of order $k$)
  based on a novel interpretation of linear equivariant layers. Building upon this
  result, we prove the convergence of $k$-IGN under the model of \citet{ruiz2020graphon},
  where we access the edge weight but the convergence error is measured for graphon
  inputs. Under the more natural (and more challenging) setting of \citet{keriven2020convergence}
  where one can only access 0-1 adjacency matrix sampled according to edge probability,
  we first show a negative result that the convergence of any IGN is not possible.
  We then obtain the convergence of a subset of IGNs, denoted as IGN-small, after
  the edge probability estimation. We show that IGN-small still contains function
  class rich enough that can approximate spectral GNNs arbitrarily well. Lastly, we
  perform experiments on various graphon models to verify our statements.
