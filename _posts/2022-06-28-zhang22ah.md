title: 'Expression might be enough: representing pressure and demand for reinforcement
  learning based traffic signal control'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Many studies confirmed that a proper traffic state representation is more
  important than complex algorithms for the classical traffic signal control (TSC)
  problem. In this paper, we (1) present a novel, flexible and efficient method, namely
  advanced max pressure (Advanced-MP), taking both running and queuing vehicles into
  consideration to decide whether to change current signal phase; (2) inventively
  design the traffic movement representation with the efficient pressure and effective
  running vehicles from Advanced-MP, namely advanced traffic state (ATS); and (3)
  develop a reinforcement learning (RL) based algorithm template, called Advanced-XLight,
  by combining ATS with the latest RL approaches, and generate two RL algorithms,
  namely "Advanced-MPLight" and "Advanced-CoLight" from Advanced-XLight. Comprehensive
  experiments on multiple real-world datasets show that: (1) the Advanced-MP outperforms
  baseline methods, and it is also efficient and reliable for deployment; and (2)
  Advanced-MPLight and Advanced-CoLight can achieve the state-of-the-art.'
