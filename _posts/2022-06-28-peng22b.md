title: 'Pocket2Mol: Efficient Molecular Sampling Based on 3D Protein Pockets'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Deep generative models have achieved tremendous success in designing novel
  drug molecules in recent years. A new thread of works have shown potential in advancing
  the specificity and success rate of in silico drug design by considering the structure
  of protein pockets. This setting posts fundamental computational challenges in sampling
  new chemical compounds that could satisfy multiple geometrical constraints imposed
  by pockets. Previous sampling algorithms either sample in the graph space or only
  consider the 3D coordinates of atoms while ignoring other detailed chemical structures
  such as bond types and functional groups. To address the challenge, we develop an
  E(3)-equivariant generative network composed of two modules: 1) a new graph neural
  network capturing both spatial and bonding relationships between atoms of the binding
  pockets and 2) a new efficient algorithm which samples new drug candidates conditioned
  on the pocket representations from a tractable distribution without relying on MCMC.
  Experimental results demonstrate that molecules sampled from Pocket2Mol achieve
  significantly better binding affinity and other drug properties such as drug-likeness
  and synthetic accessibility.'
