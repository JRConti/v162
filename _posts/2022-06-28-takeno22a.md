title: Sequential and Parallel Constrained Max-value Entropy Search via Information
  Lower Bound
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Max-value entropy search (MES) is one of the state-of-the-art approaches
  in Bayesian optimization (BO). In this paper, we propose a novel variant of MES
  for constrained problems, called Constrained MES via Information lower BOund (CMES-IBO),
  that is based on a Monte Carlo (MC) estimator of a lower bound of a mutual information
  (MI). Unlike existing studies, our MI is defined so that uncertainty with respect
  to feasibility can be incorporated. We derive a lower bound of the MI that guarantees
  non-negativity, while a constrained counterpart of conventional MES can be negative.
  We further provide theoretical analysis that assures the low-variability of our
  estimator which has never been investigated for any existing information-theoretic
  BO. Moreover, using the conditional MI, we extend CMES-IBO to the parallel setting
  while maintaining the desirable properties. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
  CMES-IBO by several benchmark functions and real-world problems.
