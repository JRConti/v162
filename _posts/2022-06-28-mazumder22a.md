  Continuous Features'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Decision trees are one of the most useful and popular methods in the machine
  learning toolbox. In this paper, we consider the problem of learning optimal decision
  trees, a combinatorial optimization problem that is challenging to solve at scale.
  A common approach in the literature is to use greedy heuristics, which may not be
  optimal. Recently there has been significant interest in learning optimal decision
  trees using various approaches (e.g., based on integer programming, dynamic programming)—to
  achieve computational scalability, most of these approaches focus on classification
  tasks with binary features. In this paper, we present a new discrete optimization
  method based on branch-and-bound (BnB) to obtain optimal decision trees. Different
  from existing customized approaches, we consider both regression and classification
  tasks with continuous features. The basic idea underlying our approach is to split
  the search space based on the quantiles of the feature distribution—leading to upper
  and lower bounds for the underlying optimization problem along the BnB iterations.
  Our proposed algorithm Quant-BnB shows significant speedups compared to existing
  approaches for shallow optimal trees on various real datasets.
