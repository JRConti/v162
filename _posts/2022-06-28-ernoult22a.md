title: Towards Scaling Difference Target Propagation by Learning Backprop Targets
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The development of biologically-plausible learning algorithms is important
  for understanding learning in the brain, but most of them fail to scale-up to real-world
  tasks, limiting their potential as explanations for learning by real brains. As
  such, it is important to explore learning algorithms that come with strong theoretical
  guarantees and can match the performance of backpropagation (BP) on complex tasks.
  One such algorithm is Difference Target Propagation (DTP), a biologically-plausible
  learning algorithm whose close relation with Gauss-Newton (GN) optimization has
  been recently established. However, the conditions under which this connection rigorously
  holds preclude layer-wise training of the feedback pathway synaptic weights (which
  is more biologically plausible). Moreover, good alignment between DTP weight updates
  and loss gradients is only loosely guaranteed and under very specific conditions
  for the architecture being trained. In this paper, we propose a novel feedback weight
  training scheme that ensures both that DTP approximates BP and that layer-wise feedback
  weight training can be restored without sacrificing any theoretical guarantees.
  Our theory is corroborated by experimental results and we report the best performance
  ever achieved by DTP on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet 32x32.
