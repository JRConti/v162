title: Adaptive Model Design for Markov Decision Process
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In a Markov decision process (MDP), an agent interacts with the environment
  via perceptions and actions. During this process, the agent aims to maximize its
  own gain. Hence, appropriate regulations are often required, if we hope to take
  the external costs/benefits of its actions into consideration. In this paper, we
  study how to regulate such an agent by redesigning model parameters that can affect
  the rewards and/or the transition kernels. We formulate this problem as a bilevel
  program, in which the lower-level MDP is regulated by the upper-level model designer.
  To solve the resulting problem, we develop a scheme that allows the designer to
  iteratively predict the agentâ€™s reaction by solving the MDP and then adaptively
  update model parameters based on the predicted reaction. The algorithm is first
  theoretically analyzed and then empirically tested on several MDP models arising
  in economics and robotics.
