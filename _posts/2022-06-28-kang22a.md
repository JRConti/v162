title: 'Lyapunov Density Models: Constraining Distribution Shift in Learning-Based
  Control'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Learned models and policies can generalize effectively when evaluated within
  the distribution of the training data, but can produce unpredictable and erroneous
  outputs on out-of-distribution inputs. In order to avoid distribution shift when
  deploying learning-based control algorithms, we seek a mechanism to constrain the
  agent to states and actions that resemble those that the method was trained on.
  In control theory, Lyapunov stability and control-invariant sets allow us to make
  guarantees about controllers that stabilize the system around specific states, while
  in machine learning, density models allow us to estimate the training data distribution.
  Can we combine these two concepts, producing learning-based control algorithms that
  constrain the system to in-distribution states using only in-distribution actions?
  In this paper, we propose to do this by combining concepts from Lyapunov stability
  and density estimation, introducing Lyapunov density models: a generalization of
  control Lyapunov functions and density models that provides guarantees about an
  agentâ€™s ability to stay in-distribution over its entire trajectory.'
