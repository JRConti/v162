title: Understanding and Improving Knowledge Graph Embedding for Entity Alignment
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Embedding-based entity alignment (EEA) has recently received great attention.
  Despite significant performance improvement, few efforts have been paid to facilitate
  understanding of EEA methods. Most existing studies rest on the assumption that
  a small number of pre-aligned entities can serve as anchors connecting the embedding
  spaces of two KGs. Nevertheless, no one has investigated the rationality of such
  an assumption. To fill the research gap, we define a typical paradigm abstracted
  from existing EEA methods and analyze how the embedding discrepancy between two
  potentially aligned entities is implicitly bounded by a predefined margin in the
  score function. Further, we find that such a bound cannot guarantee to be tight
  enough for alignment learning. We mitigate this problem by proposing a new approach,
  named NeoEA, to explicitly learn KG-invariant and principled entity embeddings.
  In this sense, an EEA model not only pursues the closeness of aligned entities based
  on geometric distance, but also aligns the neural ontologies of two KGs by eliminating
  the discrepancy in embedding distribution and underlying ontology knowledge. Our
  experiments demonstrate consistent and significant performance improvement against
  the best-performing EEA methods.
