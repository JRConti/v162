title: Stochastic Reweighted Gradient Descent
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Importance sampling is a promising strategy for improving the convergence
  rate of stochastic gradient methods. It is typically used to precondition the optimization
  problem, but it can also be used to reduce the variance of the gradient estimator.
  Unfortunately, this latter point of view has yet to lead to practical methods that
  provably improve the asymptotic error of stochastic gradient methods. In this work,
  we propose stochastic reweighted gradient descent (SRG), a stochastic gradient method
  based solely on importance sampling that can reduce the variance of the gradient
  estimator and improve on the asymptotic error of stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
  in the strongly convex and smooth case. We show that SRG can be extended to combine
  the benefits of both importance-sampling-based preconditioning and variance reduction.
  When compared to SGD, the resulting algorithm can simultaneously reduce the condition
  number and the asymptotic error, both by up to a factor equal to the number of component
  functions. We demonstrate improved convergence in practice on regularized logistic
  regression problems.
