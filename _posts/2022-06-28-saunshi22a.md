title: Understanding Contrastive Learning Requires Incorporating Inductive Biases
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Contrastive learning is a popular form of self-supervised learning that
  encourages augmentations (views) of the same input to have more similar representations
  compared to augmentations of different inputs. Recent attempts to theoretically
  explain the success of contrastive learning on downstream classification tasks prove
  guarantees depending on properties of <em>augmentations</em> and the value of <em>contrastive
  loss</em> of representations. We demonstrate that such analyses, that ignore <em>inductive
  biases</em> of the function class and training algorithm, cannot adequately explain
  the success of contrastive learning, even <em>provably</em> leading to vacuous guarantees
  in some settings. Extensive experiments on image and text domains highlight the
  ubiquity of this problem â€“ different function classes and algorithms behave very
  differently on downstream tasks, despite having the same augmentations and contrastive
  losses. Theoretical analysis is presented for the class of linear representations,
  where incorporating inductive biases of the function class allows contrastive learning
  to work with less stringent conditions compared to prior analyses.
