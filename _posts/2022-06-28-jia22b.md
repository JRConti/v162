booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We present Translatotron 2, a neural direct speech-to-speech translation
  model that can be trained end-to-end. Translatotron 2 consists of a speech encoder,
  a linguistic decoder, an acoustic synthesizer, and a single attention module that
  connects them together. Experimental results on three datasets consistently show
  that Translatotron 2 outperforms the original Translatotron by a large margin on
  both translation quality (up to +15.5 BLEU) and speech generation quality, and approaches
  the same of cascade systems. In addition, we propose a simple method for preserving
  speakers’ voices from the source speech to the translation speech in a different
  language. Unlike existing approaches, the proposed method is able to preserve each
  speaker’s voice on speaker turns without requiring for speaker segmentation. Furthermore,
  compared to existing approaches, it better preserves speaker’s privacy and mitigates
  potential misuse of voice cloning for creating spoofing audio artifacts.
