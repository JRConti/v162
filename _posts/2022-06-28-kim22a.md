title: Multi-Level Branched Regularization for Federated Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: A critical challenge of federated learning is data heterogeneity and imbalance
  across clients, which leads to inconsistency between local networks and unstable
  convergence of global models. To alleviate the limitations, we propose a novel architectural
  regularization technique that constructs multiple auxiliary branches in each local
  model by grafting local and global subnetworks at several different levels and that
  learns the representations of the main pathway in the local model congruent to the
  auxiliary hybrid pathways via online knowledge distillation. The proposed technique
  is effective to robustify the global model even in the non-iid setting and is applicable
  to various federated learning frameworks conveniently without incurring extra communication
  costs. We perform comprehensive empirical studies and demonstrate remarkable performance
  gains in terms of accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods. The source
  code is available at our project page.
