title: Three-stage Evolution and Fast Equilibrium for SGD with Non-degerate Critical
  Points
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'We justify the fast equilibrium conjecture on stochastic gradient descent
  from (Li et al. 2020) under the assumptions that critical points are non-degenerate
  and the stochastic noise is a standard Gaussian. In this case, we prove an SGD with
  constant effective learning rate consists of three stages: descent, diffusion and
  tunneling, and explicitly identify temporary equilibrium states in the normalized
  parameter space that can be observed within practical training time. This interprets
  the gap between the mixing time in the fast equilibrium conjecture and the previously
  known upper bound. While our assumptions do not represent typical implementations
  of SGD of neural networks in practice, this is the first description of the three-stage
  mechanism in any case. The main finding in this mechanism is that a temporary equilibrium
  of local nature is quickly achieved after polynomial time (in term of the reciprocal
  of the intrinsic learning rate) and then stabilizes within observable time scales;
  and that the temporary equilibrium is in general different from the global Gibbs
  equilibrium, which will only appear after an exponentially long period beyond typical
  training limits. Our experiments support that this mechanism may extend to the general
  case.'
