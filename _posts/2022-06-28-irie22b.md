title: A Modern Self-Referential Weight Matrix That Learns to Modify Itself
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: The weight matrix (WM) of a neural network (NN) is its program. The programs
  of many traditional NNs are learned through gradient descent in some error function,
  then remain fixed. The WM of a self-referential NN, however, can keep rapidly modifying
  all of itself during runtime. In principle, such NNs can meta-learn to learn, and
  meta-meta-learn to meta-learn to learn, and so on, in the sense of recursive self-improvement.
  While NN architectures potentially capable of implementing such behaviour have been
  proposed since the ’90s, there have been few if any practical studies. Here we revisit
  such NNs, building upon recent successes of fast weight programmers and closely
  related linear Transformers. We propose a scalable self-referential WM (SRWM) that
  learns to use outer products and the delta update rule to modify itself. We evaluate
  our SRWM in supervised few-shot learning and in multi-task reinforcement learning
  with procedurally generated game environments. Our experiments demonstrate both
  practical applicability and competitive performance of the proposed SRWM. Our code
  is public.
