title: 'LSB: Local Self-Balancing MCMC in Discrete Spaces'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We present the Local Self-Balancing sampler (LSB), a local Markov Chain
  Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for sampling in purely discrete domains, which is able
  to autonomously adapt to the target distribution and to reduce the number of target
  evaluations required to converge. LSB is based on (i) a parametrization of locally
  balanced proposals, (ii) an objective function based on mutual information and (iii)
  a self-balancing learning procedure, which minimises the proposed objective to update
  the proposal parameters. Experiments on energy-based models and Markov networks
  show that LSB converges using a smaller number of queries to the oracle distribution
  compared to recent local MCMC samplers.
