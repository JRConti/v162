title: Generalized Beliefs for Cooperative AI
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Self-play is a common method for constructing solutions in Markov games
  that can yield optimal policies in collaborative settings. However, these policies
  often adopt highly-specialized conventions that make playing with a novel partner
  difficult. To address this, recent approaches rely on encoding symmetry and convention-awareness
  into policy training, but these require strong environmental assumptions and can
  complicate policy training. To overcome this, we propose moving the learning of
  conventions to the belief space. Specifically, we propose a belief learning paradigm
  that can maintain beliefs over rollouts of policies not seen at training time, and
  can thus decode and adapt to novel conventions at test time. We show how to leverage
  this belief model for both search and training of a best response over a pool of
  policies to greatly improve zero-shot coordination. We also show how our paradigm
  promotes explainability and interpretability of nuanced agent conventions.
