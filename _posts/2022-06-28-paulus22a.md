title: 'Learning to Cut by Looking Ahead: Cutting Plane Selection via Imitation Learning'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Cutting planes are essential for solving mixed-integer linear problems (MILPs),
  because they facilitate bound improvements on the optimal solution value. For selecting
  cuts, modern solvers rely on manually designed heuristics that are tuned to gauge
  the potential effectiveness of cuts. We show that a greedy selection rule explicitly
  looking ahead to select cuts that yield the best bound improvement delivers strong
  decisions for cut selection â€“ but is too expensive to be deployed in practice. In
  response, we propose a new neural architecture (NeuralCut) for imitation learning
  on the lookahead expert. Our model outperforms standard baselines for cut selection
  on several synthetic MILP benchmarks. Experiments on a realistic B&C solver further
  validate our approach, and exhibit the potential of learning methods in this setting.
