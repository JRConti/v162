title: Causal Dynamics Learning for Task-Independent State Abstraction
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Learning dynamics models accurately is an important goal for Model-Based
  Reinforcement Learning (MBRL), but most MBRL methods learn a dense dynamics model
  which is vulnerable to spurious correlations and therefore generalizes poorly to
  unseen states. In this paper, we introduce Causal Dynamics Learning for Task-Independent
  State Abstraction (CDL), which first learns a theoretically proved causal dynamics
  model that removes unnecessary dependencies between state variables and the action,
  thus generalizing well to unseen states. A state abstraction can then be derived
  from the learned dynamics, which not only improves sample efficiency but also applies
  to a wider range of tasks than existing state abstraction methods. Evaluated on
  two simulated environments and downstream tasks, both the dynamics model and policies
  learned by the proposed method generalize well to unseen states and the derived
  state abstraction improves sample efficiency compared to learning without it.
