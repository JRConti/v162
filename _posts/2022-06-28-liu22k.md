booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Model fusion without accessing training data in machine learning has attracted
  increasing interest due to the practical resource-saving and data privacy issues.
  During the training process, the neural weights of each model can be randomly permuted,
  and we have to align the channels of each layer before fusing them. Regrading the
  channels as nodes and weights as edges, aligning the channels to maximize weight
  similarity is a challenging NP-hard assignment problem. Due to its quadratic assignment
  nature, we formulate the model fusion problem as a graph matching task, considering
  the second-order similarity of model weights instead of previous work merely formulating
  model fusion as a linear assignment problem. For the rising problem scale and multi-model
  consistency issues, we propose an efficient graduated assignment-based model fusion
  method, dubbed GAMF, which iteratively updates the matchings in a consistency-maintaining
  manner. We apply GAMF to tackle the compact model ensemble task and federated learning
  task on MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-Imagenet. The performance shows the
  efficacy of our GAMF compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
