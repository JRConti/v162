title: Achieving Minimax Rates in Pool-Based Batch Active Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We consider a batch active learning scenario where the learner adaptively
  issues batches of points to a labeling oracle. Sampling labels in batches is highly
  desirable in practice due to the smaller number of interactive rounds with the labeling
  oracle (often human beings). However, batch active learning typically pays the price
  of a reduced adaptivity, leading to suboptimal results. In this paper we propose
  a solution which requires a careful trade off between the informativeness of the
  queried points and their diversity. We theoretically investigate batch active learning
  in the practically relevant scenario where the unlabeled pool of data is available
  beforehand (<em>pool-based</em> active learning). We analyze a novel stage-wise
  greedy algorithm and show that, as a function of the label complexity, the excess
  risk of this algorithm %operating in the realizable setting for which we prove matches
  the known minimax rates in standard statistical learning settings. Our results also
  exhibit a mild dependence on the batch size. These are the first theoretical results
  that employ careful trade offs between informativeness and diversity to rigorously
  quantify the statistical performance of batch active learning in the pool-based
  scenario.
