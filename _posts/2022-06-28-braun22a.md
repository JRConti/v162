title: An iterative clustering algorithm for the Contextual Stochastic Block Model
  with optimality guarantees
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Real-world networks often come with side information that can help to improve
  the performance of network analysis tasks such as clustering. Despite a large number
  of empirical and theoretical studies conducted on network clustering methods during
  the past decade, the added value of side information and the methods used to incorporate
  it optimally in clustering algorithms are relatively less understood. We propose
  a new iterative algorithm to cluster networks with side information for nodes (in
  the form of covariates) and show that our algorithm is optimal under the Contextual
  Symmetric Stochastic Block Model. Our algorithm can be applied to general Contextual
  Stochastic Block Models and avoids hyperparameter tuning in contrast to previously
  proposed methods. We confirm our theoretical results on synthetic data experiments
  where our algorithm significantly outperforms other methods, and show that it can
  also be applied to signed graphs. Finally we demonstrate the practical interest
  of our method on real data.
