title: Self-supervised learning with random-projection quantizer for speech recognition
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We present a simple and effective self-supervised learning approach for
  speech recognition. The approach learns a model to predict the masked speech signals,
  in the form of discrete labels generated with a random-projection quantizer. In
  particular the quantizer projects speech inputs with a randomly initialized matrix,
  and does a nearest-neighbor lookup in a randomly-initialized codebook. Neither the
  matrix nor the codebook are updated during self-supervised learning. Since the random-projection
  quantizer is not trained and is separated from the speech recognition model, the
  design makes the approach flexible and is compatible with universal speech recognition
  architecture. On LibriSpeech our approach achieves similar word-error-rates as previous
  work using self-supervised learning with non-streaming models, and provides lower
  word-error-rates than previous work with streaming models. On multilingual tasks
  the approach also provides significant improvement over wav2vec 2.0 and w2v-BERT.
