title: End-to-End Balancing for Causal Continuous Treatment-Effect Estimation
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We study the problem of observational causal inference with continuous treatment.
  We focus on the challenge of estimating the causal response curve for infrequently-observed
  treatment values. We design a new algorithm based on the framework of entropy balancing
  which learns weights that directly maximize causal inference accuracy using end-to-end
  optimization. Our weights can be customized for different datasets and causal inference
  algorithms. We propose a new theory for consistency of entropy balancing for continuous
  treatments. Using synthetic and real-world data, we show that our proposed algorithm
  outperforms the entropy balancing in terms of causal inference accuracy.
