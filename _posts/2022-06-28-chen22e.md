title: Strategies for Safe Multi-Armed Bandits with Logarithmic Regret and Risk
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We investigate a natural but surprisingly unstudied approach to the multi-armed
  bandit problem under safety risk constraints. Each arm is associated with an unknown
  law on safety risks and rewards, and the learnerâ€™s goal is to maximise reward whilst
  not playing unsafe arms, as determined by a given threshold on the mean risk. We
  formulate a pseudo-regret for this setting that enforces this safety constraint
  in a per-round way by softly penalising any violation, regardless of the gain in
  reward due to the same. This has practical relevance to scenarios such as clinical
  trials, where one must maintain safety for each round rather than in an aggregated
  sense. We describe doubly optimistic strategies for this scenario, which maintain
  optimistic indices for both safety risk and reward. We show that schema based on
  both frequentist and Bayesian indices satisfy tight gap-dependent logarithmic regret
  bounds, and further that these play unsafe arms only logarithmically many times
  in total. This theoretical analysis is complemented by simulation studies demonstrating
  the effectiveness of the proposed schema, and probing the domains in which their
  use is appropriate.
