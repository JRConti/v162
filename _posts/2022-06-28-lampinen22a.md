title: Tell me why! Explanations support learning relational and causal structure
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Inferring the abstract relational and causal structure of the world is a
  major challenge for reinforcement-learning (RL) agents. For humans, language{—}particularly
  in the form of explanations{—}plays a considerable role in overcoming this challenge.
  Here, we show that language can play a similar role for deep RL agents in complex
  environments. While agents typically struggle to acquire relational and causal knowledge,
  augmenting their experience by training them to predict language descriptions and
  explanations can overcome these limitations. We show that language can help agents
  learn challenging relational tasks, and examine which aspects of language contribute
  to its benefits. We then show that explanations can help agents to infer not only
  relational but also causal structure. Language can shape the way that agents to
  generalize out-of-distribution from ambiguous, causally-confounded training, and
  explanations even allow agents to learn to perform experimental interventions to
  identify causal relationships. Our results suggest that language description and
  explanation may be powerful tools for improving agent learning and generalization.
