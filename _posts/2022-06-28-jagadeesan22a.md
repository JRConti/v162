title: Regret Minimization with Performative Feedback
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'In performative prediction, the deployment of a predictive model triggers
  a shift in the data distribution. As these shifts are typically unknown ahead of
  time, the learner needs to deploy a model to get feedback about the distribution
  it induces. We study the problem of finding near-optimal models under performativity
  while maintaining low regret. On the surface, this problem might seem equivalent
  to a bandit problem. However, it exhibits a fundamentally richer feedback structure
  that we refer to as performative feedback: after every deployment, the learner receives
  samples from the shifted distribution rather than bandit feedback about the reward.
  Our main contribution is regret bounds that scale only with the complexity of the
  distribution shifts and not that of the reward function. The key algorithmic idea
  is careful exploration of the distribution shifts that informs a novel construction
  of confidence bounds on the risk of unexplored models. The construction only relies
  on smoothness of the shifts and does not assume convexity. More broadly, our work
  establishes a conceptual approach for leveraging tools from the bandits literature
  for the purpose of regret minimization with performative feedback.'
