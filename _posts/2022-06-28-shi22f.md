title: A Minimax Learning Approach to Off-Policy Evaluation in Confounded Partially
  Observable Markov Decision Processes
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We consider off-policy evaluation (OPE) in Partially Observable Markov Decision
  Processes (POMDPs), where the evaluation policy depends only on observable variables
  and the behavior policy depends on unobservable latent variables. Existing works
  either assume no unmeasured confounders, or focus on settings where both the observation
  and the state spaces are tabular. In this work, we first propose novel identification
  methods for OPE in POMDPs with latent confounders, by introducing bridge functions
  that link the target policyâ€™s value and the observed data distribution. We next
  propose minimax estimation methods for learning these bridge functions, and construct
  three estimators based on these estimated bridge functions, corresponding to a value
  function-based estimator, a marginalized importance sampling estimator, and a doubly-robust
  estimator. Our proposal permits general function approximation and is thus applicable
  to settings with continuous or large observation/state spaces. The nonasymptotic
  and asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators are investigated in detail.
  A Python implementation of our proposal is available at https://github.com/jiaweihhuang/
