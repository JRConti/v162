title: 'Reverse Engineering $\ell_p$ attacks: A block-sparse optimization approach
  with recovery guarantees'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Deep neural network-based classifiers have been shown to be vulnerable to
  imperceptible perturbations to their input, such as $\ell_p$-bounded norm adversarial
  attacks. This has motivated the development of many defense methods, which are then
  broken by new attacks, and so on. This paper focuses on a different but related
  problem of reverse engineering adversarial attacks. Specifically, given an attacked
  signal, we study conditions under which one can determine the type of attack ($\ell_1$,
  $\ell_2$ or $\ell_\infty$) and recover the clean signal. We pose this problem as
  a block-sparse recovery problem, where both the signal and the attack are assumed
  to lie in a union of subspaces that includes one subspace per class and one subspace
  per attack type. We derive geometric conditions on the subspaces under which any
  attacked signal can be decomposed as the sum of a clean signal plus an attack. In
  addition, by determining the subspaces that contain the signal and the attack, we
  can also classify the signal and determine the attack type. Experiments on digit
  and face classification demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
