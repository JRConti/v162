title: Label Ranking through Nonparametric Regression
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Label Ranking (LR) corresponds to the problem of learning a hypothesis that
  maps features to rankings over a finite set of labels. We adopt a nonparametric
  regression approach to LR and obtain theoretical performance guarantees for this
  fundamental practical problem. We introduce a generative model for Label Ranking,
  in noiseless and noisy nonparametric regression settings, and provide sample complexity
  bounds for learning algorithms in both cases. In the noiseless setting, we study
  the LR problem with full rankings and provide computationally efficient algorithms
  using decision trees and random forests in the high-dimensional regime. In the noisy
  setting, we consider the more general cases of LR with incomplete and partial rankings
  from a statistical viewpoint and obtain sample complexity bounds using the One-Versus-One
  approach of multiclass classification. Finally, we complement our theoretical contributions
  with experiments, aiming to understand how the input regression noise affects the
  observed output.
