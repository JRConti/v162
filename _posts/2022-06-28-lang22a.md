title: Co-training Improves Prompt-based Learning for Large Language Models
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We demonstrate that co-training (Blum & Mitchell, 1998) can improve the
  performance of prompt-based learning by using unlabeled data. While prompting has
  emerged as a promising paradigm for few-shot and zero-shot learning, it is often
  brittle and requires much larger models compared to the standard supervised setup.
  We find that co-training makes it possible to improve the original prompt model
  and at the same time learn a smaller, downstream task-specific model. In the case
  where we only have partial access to a prompt model (e.g., output probabilities
  from GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020)) we learn a calibration model over the prompt outputs.
  When we have full access to the prompt modelâ€™s gradients but full finetuning remains
  prohibitively expensive (e.g., T0 (Sanh et al., 2021)), we learn a set of soft prompt
  continuous vectors to iteratively update the prompt model. We find that models trained
  in this manner can significantly improve performance on challenging datasets where
  there is currently a large gap between prompt-based learning and fully-supervised
  models.
