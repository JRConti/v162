  by Progressive Training'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Federated learning is a powerful distributed learning scheme that allows
  numerous edge devices to collaboratively train a model without sharing their data.
  However, training is resource-intensive for edge devices, and limited network bandwidth
  is often the main bottleneck. Prior work often overcomes the constraints by condensing
  the models or messages into compact formats, e.g., by gradient compression or distillation.
  In contrast, we propose ProgFed, the first progressive training framework for efficient
  and effective federated learning. It inherently reduces computation and two-way
  communication costs while maintaining the strong performance of the final models.
  We theoretically prove that ProgFed converges at the same asymptotic rate as standard
  training on full models. Extensive results on a broad range of architectures, including
  CNNs (VGG, ResNet, ConvNets) and U-nets, and diverse tasks from simple classification
  to medical image segmentation show that our highly effective training approach saves
  up to $20%$ computation and up to $63%$ communication costs for converged models.
  As our approach is also complimentary to prior work on compression, we can achieve
  a wide range of trade-offs by combining these techniques, showing reduced communication
  of up to $50\times$ at only $0.1%$ loss in utility. Code is available at https://github.com/a514514772/ProgFed.
