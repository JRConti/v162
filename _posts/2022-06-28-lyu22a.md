title: On Finite-Sample Identifiability of Contrastive Learning-Based Nonlinear Independent
  Component Analysis
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Nonlinear independent component analysis (nICA) aims at recovering statistically
  independent latent components that are mixed by unknown nonlinear functions. Central
  to nICA is the identifiability of the latent components, which had been elusive
  until very recently. Specifically, Hyvärinen et al. have shown that the nonlinearly
  mixed latent components are identifiable (up to often inconsequential ambiguities)
  under a generalized contrastive learning (GCL) formulation, given that the latent
  components are independent conditioned on a certain auxiliary variable. The GCL-based
  identifiability of nICA is elegant, and establishes interesting connections between
  nICA and popular unsupervised/self-supervised learning paradigms in representation
  learning, causal learning, and factor disentanglement. However, existing identifiability
  analyses of nICA all build upon an unlimited sample assumption and the use of ideal
  universal function learners—which creates a non-negligible gap between theory and
  practice. Closing the gap is a nontrivial challenge, as there is a lack of established
  “textbook” routine for finite sample analysis of such unsupervised problems. This
  work puts forth a finite-sample identifiability analysis of GCL-based nICA. Our
  analytical framework judiciously combines the properties of the GCL loss function,
  statistical generalization analysis, and numerical differentiation. Our framework
  also takes the learning function’s approximation error into consideration, and reveals
  an intuitive trade-off between the complexity and expressiveness of the employed
  function learner. Numerical experiments are used to validate the theorems.
