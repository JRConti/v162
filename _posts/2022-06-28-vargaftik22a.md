title: 'EDEN: Communication-Efficient and Robust Distributed Mean Estimation for Federated
  Learning'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Distributed Mean Estimation (DME) is a central building block in federated
  learning, where clients send local gradients to a parameter server for averaging
  and updating the model. Due to communication constraints, clients often use lossy
  compression techniques to compress the gradients, resulting in estimation inaccuracies.
  DME is more challenging when clients have diverse network conditions, such as constrained
  communication budgets and packet losses. In such settings, DME techniques often
  incur a significant increase in the estimation error leading to degraded learning
  performance. In this work, we propose a robust DME technique named EDEN that naturally
  handles heterogeneous communication budgets and packet losses. We derive appealing
  theoretical guarantees for EDEN and evaluate it empirically. Our results demonstrate
  that EDEN consistently improves over state-of-the-art DME techniques.
