title: A Resilient Distributed Boosting Algorithm
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Given a learning task where the data is distributed among several parties,
  communication is one of the fundamental resources which the parties would like to
  minimize. We present a distributed boosting algorithm which is resilient to a limited
  amount of noise. Our algorithm is similar to classical boosting algorithms, although
  it is equipped with a new component, inspired by Impagliazzoâ€™s hard-core lemma (Impagliazzo,
  1995), adding a robustness quality to the algorithm. We also complement this result
  by showing that resilience to any asymptotically larger noise is not achievable
  by a communication-efficient algorithm.
