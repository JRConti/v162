title: Learning fair representation with a parametric integral probability metric
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: As they have a vital effect on social decision-making, AI algorithms should
  be not only accurate but also fair. Among various algorithms for fairness AI, learning
  fair representation (LFR), whose goal is to find a fair representation with respect
  to sensitive variables such as gender and race, has received much attention. For
  LFR, the adversarial training scheme is popularly employed as is done in the generative
  adversarial network type algorithms. The choice of a discriminator, however, is
  done heuristically without justification. In this paper, we propose a new adversarial
  training scheme for LFR, where the integral probability metric (IPM) with a specific
  parametric family of discriminators is used. The most notable result of the proposed
  LFR algorithm is its theoretical guarantee about the fairness of the final prediction
  model, which has not been considered yet. That is, we derive theoretical relations
  between the fairness of representation and the fairness of the prediction model
  built on the top of the representation (i.e., using the representation as the input).
  Moreover, by numerical experiments, we show that our proposed LFR algorithm is computationally
  lighter and more stable, and the final prediction model is competitive or superior
  to other LFR algorithms using more complex discriminators.
