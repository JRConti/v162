title: SSL Enables Learning from Sparse Rewards in Image-Goal Navigation
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Visual navigation through novel environments is an essential skill for intelligent
  household robots. Reinforcement learning (RL) with dense reward shaping is the standard
  approach for such visual navigation problems. Dense rewards are used despite the
  fact that they penalize exploration—a key skill for navigating in new environments—because
  of the commonly held belief that sparse rewards do not work. In this paper, we present
  a surprising finding. We demonstrate that combining sparse rewards with self-supervised
  learning (SSL) not only makes them work, but also outperforms dense rewards, which
  is the first result of this kind. We apply our approach alongside data augmentation
  to train a general-purpose agent for image-goal navigation (ImageNav), in which
  the goal is presented as an image captured from the target location. These techniques
  improve navigation success from 64% to 72% (+8), path efficiency—measured by success
  weighted by path length (SPL)—from 0.50 to 0.62 (+0.12), and also lead to a +0.06
  absolute improvement in SPL over the state-of-the-art.
