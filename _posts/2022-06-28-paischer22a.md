title: History Compression via Language Models in Reinforcement Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), an agent typically
  uses a representation of the past to approximate the underlying MDP. We propose
  to utilize a frozen Pretrained Language Transformer (PLT) for history representation
  and compression to improve sample efficiency. To avoid training of the Transformer,
  we introduce FrozenHopfield, which automatically associates observations with pretrained
  token embeddings. To form these associations, a modern Hopfield network stores these
  token embeddings, which are retrieved by queries that are obtained by a random but
  fixed projection of observations. Our new method, HELM, enables actor-critic network
  architectures that contain a pretrained language Transformer for history representation
  as a memory module. Since a representation of the past need not be learned, HELM
  is much more sample efficient than competitors. On Minigrid and Procgen environments
  HELM achieves new state-of-the-art results. Our code is available at https://github.com/ml-jku/helm.
