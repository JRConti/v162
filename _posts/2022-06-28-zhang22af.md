title: A Simple yet Universal Strategy for Online Convex Optimization
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Recently, several universal methods have been proposed for online convex
  optimization, and attain minimax rates for multiple types of convex functions simultaneously.
  However, they need to design and optimize one surrogate loss for each type of functions,
  making it difficult to exploit the structure of the problem and utilize existing
  algorithms. In this paper, we propose a simple strategy for universal online convex
  optimization, which avoids these limitations. The key idea is to construct a set
  of experts to process the original online functions, and deploy a meta-algorithm
  over the linearized losses to aggregate predictions from experts. Specifically,
  the meta-algorithm is required to yield a second-order bound with excess losses,
  so that it can leverage strong convexity and exponential concavity to control the
  meta-regret. In this way, our strategy inherits the theoretical guarantee of any
  expert designed for strongly convex functions and exponentially concave functions,
  up to a double logarithmic factor. As a result, we can plug in off-the-shelf online
  solvers as black-box experts to deliver problem-dependent regret bounds. For general
  convex functions, it maintains the minimax optimality and also achieves a small-loss
  bound.
