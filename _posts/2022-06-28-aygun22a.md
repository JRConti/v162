title: Proving Theorems using Incremental Learning and Hindsight Experience Replay
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Traditional automated theorem proving systems for first-order logic depend
  on speed-optimized search and many handcrafted heuristics designed to work over
  a wide range of domains. Machine learning approaches in the literature either depend
  on these traditional provers to bootstrap themselves, by leveraging these heuristics,
  or can struggle due to limited existing proof data. The latter issue can be explained
  by the lack of a smooth difficulty gradient in theorem proving datasets; large gaps
  in difficulty between different theorems can make training harder or even impossible.
  In this paper, we adapt the idea of hindsight experience replay from reinforcement
  learning to the automated theorem proving domain, so as to use the intermediate
  data generated during unsuccessful proof attempts. We build a first-order logic
  prover by disabling all the smart clause-scoring heuristics of the state-of-the-art
  E prover and replacing them with a clause-scoring neural network learned by using
  hindsight experience replay in an incremental learning setting. Clauses are represented
  as graphs and presented to transformer networks with spectral features. We show
  that provers trained in this way can outperform previous machine learning approaches
  and compete with the state of the art heuristic-based theorem prover E in its best
  configuration, on the popular benchmarks MPTP2078, M2k and Mizar40. The proofs generated
  by our algorithm are also almost always significantly shorter than E’s proofs.
