title: Agnostic Learnability of Halfspaces via Logistic Loss
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We investigate approximation guarantees provided by logistic regression
  for the fundamental problem of agnostic learning of homogeneous halfspaces. Previously,
  for a certain broad class of “well-behaved” distributions on the examples, Diakonikolas
  et al. (2020) proved an tilde{Omega}(OPT) lower bound, while Frei et al. (2021)
  proved an tilde{O}(sqrt{OPT}) upper bound, where OPT denotes the best zero-one/misclassification
  risk of a homogeneous halfspace. In this paper, we close this gap by constructing
  a well-behaved distribution such that the global minimizer of the logistic risk
  over this distribution only achieves Omega(sqrt{OPT}) misclassification risk, matching
  the upper bound in (Frei et al., 2021). On the other hand, we also show that if
  we impose a radial-Lipschitzness condition in addition to well-behaved-ness on the
  distribution, logistic regression on a ball of bounded radius reaches tilde{O}(OPT)
  misclassification risk. Our techniques also show for any well-behaved distribution,
  regardless of radial Lipschitzness, we can overcome the Omega(sqrt{OPT}) lower bound
  for logistic loss simply at the cost of one additional convex optimization step
  involving the hinge loss and attain tilde{O}(OPT) misclassification risk. This two-step
  convex optimization algorithm is simpler than previous methods obtaining this guarantee,
  all of which require solving O(log(1/OPT)) minimization problems.
