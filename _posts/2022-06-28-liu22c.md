title: 'Benefits of Overparameterized Convolutional Residual Networks: Function Approximation
  under Smoothness Constraint'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Overparameterized neural networks enjoy great representation power on complex
  data, and more importantly yield sufficiently smooth output, which is crucial to
  their generalization and robustness. Most existing function approximation theories
  suggest that with sufficiently many parameters, neural networks can well approximate
  certain classes of functions in terms of the function value. The neural network
  themselves, however, can be highly nonsmooth. To bridge this gap, we take convolutional
  residual networks (ConvResNets) as an example, and prove that large ConvResNets
  can not only approximate a target function in terms of function value, but also
  exhibit sufficient first-order smoothness. Moreover, we extend our theory to approximating
  functions supported on a low-dimensional manifold. Our theory partially justifies
  the benefits of using deep and wide networks in practice. Numerical experiments
  on adversarial robust image classification are provided to support our theory.
