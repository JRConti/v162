title: Gaussian Process Uniform Error Bounds with Unknown Hyperparameters for Safety-Critical
  Applications
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Gaussian processes have become a promising tool for various safety-critical
  settings, since the posterior variance can be used to directly estimate the model
  error and quantify risk. However, state-of-the-art techniques for safety-critical
  settings hinge on the assumption that the kernel hyperparameters are known, which
  does not apply in general. To mitigate this, we introduce robust Gaussian process
  uniform error bounds in settings with unknown hyperparameters. Our approach computes
  a confidence region in the space of hyperparameters, which enables us to obtain
  a probabilistic upper bound for the model error of a Gaussian process with arbitrary
  hyperparameters. We do not require to know any bounds for the hyperparameters a
  priori, which is an assumption commonly found in related work. Instead, we are able
  to derive bounds from data in an intuitive fashion. We additionally employ the proposed
  technique to derive performance guarantees for a class of learning-based control
  problems. Experiments show that the bound performs significantly better than vanilla
  and fully Bayesian Gaussian processes.
