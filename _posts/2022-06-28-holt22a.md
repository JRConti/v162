abstract: Neural Ordinary Differential Equations model dynamical systems with ODEs
  learned by neural networks. However, ODEs are fundamentally inadequate to model
  systems with long-range dependencies or discontinuities, which are common in engineering
  and biological systems. Broader classes of differential equations (DE) have been
  proposed as remedies, including delay differential equations and integro-differential
  equations. Furthermore, Neural ODE suffers from numerical instability when modelling
  stiff ODEs and ODEs with piecewise forcing functions. In this work, we propose Neural
  Laplace, a unifying framework for learning diverse classes of DEs including all
  the aforementioned ones. Instead of modelling the dynamics in the time domain, we
  model it in the Laplace domain, where the history-dependencies and discontinuities
  in time can be represented as summations of complex exponentials. To make learning
  more efficient, we use the geometrical stereographic map of a Riemann sphere to
  induce more smoothness in the Laplace domain. In the experiments, Neural Laplace
  shows superior performance in modelling and extrapolating the trajectories of diverse
  classes of DEs, including the ones with complex history dependency and abrupt changes.
