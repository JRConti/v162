title: Measure Estimation in the Barycentric Coding Model
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'This paper considers the problem of measure estimation under the barycentric
  coding model (BCM), in which an unknown measure is assumed to belong to the set
  of Wasserstein-2 barycenters of a finite set of known measures. Estimating a measure
  under this model is equivalent to estimating the unknown barycentric coordinates.
  We provide novel geometrical, statistical, and computational insights for measure
  estimation under the BCM, consisting of three main results. Our first main result
  leverages the Riemannian geometry of Wasserstein-2 space to provide a procedure
  for recovering the barycentric coordinates as the solution to a quadratic optimization
  problem assuming access to the true reference measures. The essential geometric
  insight is that the parameters of this quadratic problem are determined by inner
  products between the optimal displacement maps from the given measure to the reference
  measures defining the BCM. Our second main result then establishes an algorithm
  for solving for the coordinates in the BCM when all the measures are observed empirically
  via i.i.d. samples. We prove precise rates of convergence for this algorithm—determined
  by the smoothness of the underlying measures and their dimensionality—thereby guaranteeing
  its statistical consistency. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the BCM and
  associated estimation procedures in three application areas: (i) covariance estimation
  for Gaussian measures; (ii) image processing; and (iii) natural language processing.'
