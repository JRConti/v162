title: Fictitious Play and Best-Response Dynamics in Identical Interest and Zero-Sum
  Stochastic Games
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: This paper proposes an extension of a popular decentralized discrete-time
  learning procedure when repeating a static game called fictitious play (FP) (Brown,
  1951; Robinson, 1951) to a dynamic model called discounted stochastic game (Shapley,
  1953). Our family of discrete-time FP procedures is proven to converge to the set
  of stationary Nash equilibria in identical interest discounted stochastic games.
  This extends similar convergence results for static games (Monderer & Shapley, 1996a).
  We then analyze the continuous-time counterpart of our FP procedures, which include
  as a particular case the best-response dynamic introduced and studied by Leslie
  et al. (2020) in the context of zero-sum stochastic games. We prove the converge
  of this dynamics to stationary Nash equilibria in identical-interest and zero-sum
  discounted stochastic games. Thanks to stochastic approximations, we can infer from
  the continuous-time convergence some discrete time results such as the convergence
  to stationary equilibria in zero-sum and team stochastic games (Holler, 2020).
