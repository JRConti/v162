title: Latent Diffusion Energy-Based Model for Interpretable Text Modelling
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Latent space Energy-Based Models (EBMs), also known as energy-based priors,
  have drawn growing interests in generative modeling. Fueled by its flexibility in
  the formulation and strong modeling power of the latent space, recent works built
  upon it have made interesting attempts aiming at the interpretability of text modeling.
  However, latent space EBMs also inherit some flaws from EBMs in data space; the
  degenerate MCMC sampling quality in practice can lead to poor generation quality
  and instability in training, especially on data with complex latent structures.
  Inspired by the recent efforts that leverage diffusion recovery likelihood learning
  as a cure for the sampling issue, we introduce a novel symbiosis between the diffusion
  models and latent space EBMs in a variational learning framework, coined as the
  latent diffusion energy-based model. We develop a geometric clustering-based regularization
  jointly with the information bottleneck to further improve the quality of the learned
  latent space. Experiments on several challenging tasks demonstrate the superior
  performance of our model on interpretable text modeling over strong counterparts.
