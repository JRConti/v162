title: Lagrangian Method for Q-Function Learning (with Applications to Machine Translation)
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: This paper discusses a new approach to the fundamental problem of learning
  optimal Q-functions. In this approach, optimal Q-functions are formulated as saddle
  points of a nonlinear Lagrangian function derived from the classic Bellman optimality
  equation. The paper shows that the Lagrangian enjoys strong duality, in spite of
  its nonlinearity, which paves the way to a general Lagrangian method to Q-function
  learning. As a demonstration, the paper develops an imitation learning algorithm
  based on the duality theory, and applies the algorithm to a state-of-the-art machine
  translation benchmark. The paper then turns to demonstrate a symmetry breaking phenomenon
  regarding the optimality of the Lagrangian saddle points, which justifies a largely
  overlooked direction in developing the Lagrangian method.
