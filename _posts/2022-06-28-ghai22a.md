title: A Regret Minimization Approach to Multi-Agent Control
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We study the problem of multi-agent control of a dynamical system with known
  dynamics and adversarial disturbances. Our study focuses on optimal control without
  centralized precomputed policies, but rather with adaptive control policies for
  the different agents that are only equipped with a stabilizing controller. We give
  a reduction from any (standard) regret minimizing control method to a distributed
  algorithm. The reduction guarantees that the resulting distributed algorithm has
  low regret relative to the optimal precomputed joint policy. Our methodology involves
  generalizing online convex optimization to a multi-agent setting and applying recent
  tools from nonstochastic control derived for a single agent. We empirically evaluate
  our method on a model of an overactuated aircraft. We show that the distributed
  method is robust to failure and to adversarial perturbations in the dynamics.
