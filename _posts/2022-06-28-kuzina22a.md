title: Equivariant Priors for compressed sensing with unknown orientation
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In compressed sensing, the goal is to reconstruct the signal from an underdetermined
  system of linear measurements. Thus, prior knowledge about the signal of interest
  and its structure is required. Additionally, in many scenarios, the signal has an
  unknown orientation prior to measurements. To address such recovery problems, we
  propose using equivariant generative models as a prior, which encapsulate orientation
  information in their latent space. Thereby, we show that signals with unknown orientations
  can be recovered with iterative gradient descent on the latent space of these models
  and provide additional theoretical recovery guarantees. We construct an equivariant
  variational autoencoder and use the decoder as generative prior for compressed sensing.
  We discuss additional potential gains of the proposed approach in terms of convergence
  and latency.
