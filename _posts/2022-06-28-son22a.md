title: Disentangling Sources of Risk for Distributional Multi-Agent Reinforcement
  Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'In cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning, the outcomes of agent-wise
  policies are highly stochastic due to the two sources of risk: (a) random actions
  taken by teammates and (b) random transition and rewards. Although the two sources
  have very distinct characteristics, existing frameworks are insufficient to control
  the risk-sensitivity of agent-wise policies in a disentangled manner. To this end,
  we propose Disentangled RIsk-sensitive Multi-Agent reinforcement learning (DRIMA)
  to separately access the risk sources. For example, our framework allows an agent
  to be optimistic with respect to teammates (who can prosocially adapt) but more
  risk-neutral with respect to the environment (which does not adapt). Our experiments
  demonstrate that DRIMA significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods
  across various scenarios in the StarCraft Multi-agent Challenge environment. Notably,
  DRIMA shows robust performance where prior methods learn only a highly suboptimal
  policy, regardless of reward shaping, exploration scheduling, and noisy (random
  or adversarial) agents.'
