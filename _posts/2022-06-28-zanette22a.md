title: Stabilizing Q-learning with Linear Architectures for Provable Efficient Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'The Q-learning algorithm is a simple, fundamental and practically very
  effective reinforcement learning algorithm. However, the basic protocol can exhibit
  an unstable behavior when implemented even with simple linear function approximation.
  While tools like target networks and experience replay are often implemented to
  stabilize the learning process, the individual contribution of each of these mechanisms
  is not well understood theoretically. This work proposes an exploration variant
  of the basic Q-learning protocol with linear function approximation. Our modular
  analysis illustrates the role played by each algorithmic tool that we adopt: a second
  order update rule, a set of target networks, and a mechanism akin to experience
  replay. Together, they enable state of the art regret bounds on linear MDPs while
  preserving the most prominent feature of the algorithm, namely a space complexity
  independent of the number of steps elapsed. Furthermore, we show that the performance
  of the algorithm degrades very gracefully under a new, more permissive notion of
  approximation error. Finally, the algorithm partially inherits problem dependent
  regret bounds, function of the number of ‘effective’ feature dimension.'
