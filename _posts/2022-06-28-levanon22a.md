title: Generalized Strategic Classification and the Case of Aligned Incentives
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Strategic classification studies learning in settings where self-interested
  users can strategically modify their features to obtain favorable predictive outcomes.
  A key working assumption, however, is that “favorable” always means “positive”;
  this may be appropriate in some applications (e.g., loan approval), but reduces
  to a fairly narrow view of what user interests can be. In this work we argue for
  a broader perspective on what accounts for strategic user behavior, and propose
  and study a flexible model of generalized strategic classification. Our generalized
  model subsumes most current models but includes other novel settings; among these,
  we identify and target one intriguing sub-class of problems in which the interests
  of users and the system are aligned. This setting reveals a surprising fact: that
  standard max-margin losses are ill-suited for strategic inputs. Returning to our
  fully generalized model, we propose a novel max-margin framework for strategic learning
  that is practical and effective, and which we analyze theoretically. We conclude
  with a set of experiments that empirically demonstrate the utility of our approach.'
