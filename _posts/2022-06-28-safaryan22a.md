title: 'FedNL: Making Newton-Type Methods Applicable to Federated Learning'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Inspired by recent work of Islamov et al (2021), we propose a family of
  Federated Newton Learn (\algname{FedNL}) methods, which we believe is a marked step
  in the direction of making second-order methods applicable to FL. In contrast to
  the aforementioned work, \algname{FedNL} employs a different Hessian learning technique
  which i) enhances privacy as it does not rely on the training data to be revealed
  to the coordinating server, ii) makes it applicable beyond generalized linear models,
  and iii) provably works with general contractive compression operators for compressing
  the local Hessians, such as Top-$K$ or Rank-$R$, which are vastly superior in practice.
  Notably, we do not need to rely on error feedback for our methods to work with contractive
  compressors. Moreover, we develop \algname{FedNL-PP}, \algname{FedNL-CR} and \algname{FedNL-LS},
  which are variants of \algname{FedNL} that support partial participation, and globalization
  via cubic regularization and line search, respectively, and \algname{FedNL-BC},
  which is a variant that can further benefit from bidirectional compression of gradients
  and models, i.e., smart uplink gradient and smart downlink model compression. We
  prove local convergence rates that are independent of the condition number, the
  number of training data points, and compression variance. Our communication efficient
  Hessian learning technique provably learns the Hessian at the optimum. Finally,
  we perform a variety of numerical experiments that show that our \algname{FedNL}
  methods have state-of-the-art communication complexity when compared to key baselines.
