title: Thresholded Lasso Bandit
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In this paper, we revisit the regret minimization problem in sparse stochastic
  contextual linear bandits, where feature vectors may be of large dimension $d$,
  but where the reward function depends on a few, say $s_0\ll d$, of these features
  only. We present Thresholded Lasso bandit, an algorithm that (i) estimates the vector
  defining the reward function as well as its sparse support, i.e., significant feature
  elements, using the Lasso framework with thresholding, and (ii) selects an arm greedily
  according to this estimate projected on its support. The algorithm does not require
  prior knowledge of the sparsity index $s_0$ and can be parameter-free under some
  symmetric assumptions. For this simple algorithm, we establish non-asymptotic regret
  upper bounds scaling as $\mathcal{O}( \log d + \sqrt{T} )$ in general, and as $\mathcal{O}(
  \log d + \log T)$ under the so-called margin condition (a probabilistic condition
  on the separation of the arm rewards). The regret of previous algorithms scales
  as $\mathcal{O}( \log d + \sqrt{T \log (d T)})$ and $\mathcal{O}( \log T \log d)$
  in the two settings, respectively. Through numerical experiments, we confirm that
  our algorithm outperforms existing methods.
