title: 'From block-Toeplitz matrices to differential equations on graphs: towards
  a general theory for scalable masked Transformers'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In this paper we provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first comprehensive
  approach for incorporating various masking mechanisms into Transformers architectures
  in a scalable way. We show that recent results on linear causal attention (Choromanski
  et al., 2021) and log-linear RPE-attention (Luo et al., 2021) are special cases
  of this general mechanism. However by casting the problem as a topological (graph-based)
  modulation of unmasked attention, we obtain several results unknown before, including
  efficient d-dimensional RPE-masking and graph-kernel masking. We leverage many mathematical
  techniques ranging from spectral analysis through dynamic programming and random
  walks to new algorithms for solving Markov processes on graphs. We provide a corresponding
  empirical evaluation.
