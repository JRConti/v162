abstract: Negative sampling (NS) loss plays an important role in learning knowledge
  graph embedding (KGE) to handle a huge number of entities. However, the performance
  of KGE degrades without hyperparameters such as the margin term and number of negative
  samples in NS loss being appropriately selected. Currently, empirical hyperparameter
  tuning addresses this problem at the cost of computational time. To solve this problem,
  we theoretically analyzed NS loss to assist hyperparameter tuning and understand
  the better use of the NS loss in KGE learning. Our theoretical analysis showed that
  scoring methods with restricted value ranges, such as TransE and RotatE, require
  appropriate adjustment of the margin term or the number of negative samples different
  from those without restricted value ranges, such as RESCAL, ComplEx, and DistMult.
  We also propose subsampling methods specialized for the NS loss in KGE studied from
  a theoretical aspect. Our empirical analysis on the FB15k-237, WN18RR, and YAGO3-10
  datasets showed that the results of actually trained models agree with our theoretical
  findings.
