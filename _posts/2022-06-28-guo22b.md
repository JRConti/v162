title: No-Regret Learning in Partially-Informed Auctions
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Auctions with partially-revealed information about items are broadly employed
  in real-world applications, but the underlying mechanisms have limited theoretical
  support. In this work, we study a machine learning formulation of these types of
  mechanisms, presenting algorithms that are no-regret from the buyer’s perspective.
  Specifically, a buyer who wishes to maximize his utility interacts repeatedly with
  a platform over a series of $T$ rounds. In each round, a new item is drawn from
  an unknown distribution and the platform publishes a price together with incomplete,
  “masked” information about the item. The buyer then decides whether to purchase
  the item. We formalize this problem as an online learning task where the goal is
  to have low regret with respect to a myopic oracle that has perfect knowledge of
  the distribution over items and the seller’s masking function. When the distribution
  over items is known to the buyer and the mask is a SimHash function mapping $\R^d$
  to $\{0,1\}^{\ell}$, our algorithm has regret $\tilde \cO((Td\ell)^{\nicefrac{1}{2}})$.
  In a fully agnostic setting when the mask is an arbitrary function mapping to a
  set of size $n$ and the prices are stochastic, our algorithm has regret $\tilde
  \cO((Tn)^{\nicefrac{1}{2}})$.
