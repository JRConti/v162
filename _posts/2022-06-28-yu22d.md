title: Reachability Constrained Reinforcement Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Constrained reinforcement learning (CRL) has gained significant interest
  recently, since safety constraints satisfaction is critical for real-world problems.
  However, existing CRL methods constraining discounted cumulative costs generally
  lack rigorous definition and guarantee of safety. In contrast, in the safe control
  research, safety is defined as persistently satisfying certain state constraints.
  Such persistent safety is possible only on a subset of the state space, called feasible
  set, where an optimal largest feasible set exists for a given environment. Recent
  studies incorporate feasible sets into CRL with energy-based methods such as control
  barrier function (CBF), safety index (SI), and leverage prior conservative estimations
  of feasible sets, which harms the performance of the learned policy. To deal with
  this problem, this paper proposes the reachability CRL (RCRL) method by using reachability
  analysis to establish the novel self-consistency condition and characterize the
  feasible sets. The feasible sets are represented by the safety value function, which
  is used as the constraint in CRL. We use the multi-time scale stochastic approximation
  theory to prove that the proposed algorithm converges to a local optimum, where
  the largest feasible set can be guaranteed. Empirical results on different benchmarks
  validate the learned feasible set, the policy performance, and constraint satisfaction
  of RCRL, compared to CRL and safe control baselines.
