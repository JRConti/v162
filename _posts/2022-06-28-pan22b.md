title: A Unified Weight Initialization Paradigm for Tensorial Convolutional Neural
  Networks
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Tensorial Convolutional Neural Networks (TCNNs) have attracted much research
  attention for their power in reducing model parameters or enhancing the generalization
  ability. However, exploration of TCNNs is hindered even from weight initialization
  methods. To be specific, general initialization methods, such as Xavier or Kaiming
  initialization, usually fail to generate appropriate weights for TCNNs. Meanwhile,
  although there are ad-hoc approaches for specific architectures (e.g., Tensor Ring
  Nets), they are not applicable to TCNNs with other tensor decomposition methods
  (e.g., CP or Tucker decomposition). To address this problem, we propose a universal
  weight initialization paradigm, which generalizes Xavier and Kaiming methods and
  can be widely applicable to arbitrary TCNNs. Specifically, we first present the
  Reproducing Transformation to convert the backward process in TCNNs to an equivalent
  convolution process. Then, based on the convolution operators in the forward and
  backward processes, we build a unified paradigm to control the variance of features
  and gradients in TCNNs. Thus, we can derive fan-in and fan-out initialization for
  various TCNNs. We demonstrate that our paradigm can stabilize the training of TCNNs,
  leading to faster convergence and better results.
