title: Balancing Discriminability and Transferability for Source-Free Domain Adaptation
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Conventional domain adaptation (DA) techniques aim to improve domain transferability
  by learning domain-invariant representations; while concurrently preserving the
  task-discriminability knowledge gathered from the labeled source data. However,
  the requirement of simultaneous access to labeled source and unlabeled target renders
  them unsuitable for the challenging source-free DA setting. The trivial solution
  of realizing an effective original to generic domain mapping improves transferability
  but degrades task discriminability. Upon analyzing the hurdles from both theoretical
  and empirical standpoints, we derive novel insights to show that a mixup between
  original and corresponding translated generic samples enhances the discriminability-transferability
  trade-off while duly respecting the privacy-oriented source-free setting. A simple
  but effective realization of the proposed insights on top of the existing source-free
  DA approaches yields state-of-the-art performance with faster convergence. Beyond
  single-source, we also outperform multi-source prior-arts across both classification
  and semantic segmentation benchmarks.
