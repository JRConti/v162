title: Identifiability Conditions for Domain Adaptation
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Domain adaptation algorithms and theory have relied upon an assumption that
  the observed data uniquely specify the correct correspondence between the domains.
  Unfortunately, it is unclear under what conditions this identifiability assumption
  holds, even when restricting ourselves to the case where a correct bijective map
  between domains exists. We study this bijective domain mapping problem and provide
  several new sufficient conditions for the identifiability of linear domain maps.
  As a consequence of our analysis, we show that weak constraints on the third moment
  tensor suffice for identifiability, prove identifiability for common latent variable
  models such as topic models, and give a computationally tractable method for generating
  certificates for the identifiability of linear maps. Inspired by our certification
  method, we derive a new objective function for domain mapping that explicitly accounts
  for uncertainty over maps arising from unidentifiability. We demonstrate that our
  objective leads to improvements in uncertainty quantification and model performance
  estimation.
